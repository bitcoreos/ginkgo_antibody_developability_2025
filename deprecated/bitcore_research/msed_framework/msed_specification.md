# Minimum Safe-Edit Distance (MSED) Framework Specification

## Overview
The MSED framework quantifies the minimal sequence modifications required to transition an antibody from high-risk to low-risk developability states. This creates a dynamic, actionable metric that transforms developability assessment from static risk prediction to dynamic repairability quantification.

## Core Components

### 1. Isotype-Specific Safe Manifolds
- Define separate safe regions for IgG1, IgG2, IgG4 based on analysis of 106 approved antibodies
- Utilize PROPHET-Ab data for robust safe region definition
- Implement position-specific tolerance derived from natural antibody repertoires

### 2. Generative Guidance System
- Replace simple gradient-guided search with diffusion model guidance
- Adapt approach from PRXLife: property-guided antibody sequence and structure co-design
- Enable more realistic edit proposals with biological constraints

### 3. Biophysical Constraints
- Incorporate explicit constraints on:
  - CDR-H3 length
  - Disulfide bonding patterns
  - VH-VL interface stability
  - Hydrophobicity and charge profiles

### 4. Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture
- **Sequence Encoder**: AntiBERTy/AbLang
- **Structure Encoder**: IgFoldModel
- **Fusion Mechanism**: Cross-Attention layer
- **Output Heads**: Multi-task regression for HIC, CHO, AC-SINS, Tm2, Titer

### 5. Dynamic Weighting System
- Adjust edit penalties based on position-specific tolerance
- Modulate safe manifold boundaries with buffer conditions (pH, ionic strength)
- Implement uncertainty quantification based on distance to training data manifold

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. Extract isotype-specific developability baselines from 106 approved antibodies
2. Curate natural antibody repertoire data for position-specific tolerance
3. Prepare PROPHET-Ab dataset for safe region definition

### Phase 2: Model Architecture
1. Implement backbone using AntiBERTy for sequence encoding
2. Integrate IgFoldModel for structural feature extraction
3. Develop cross-attention mechanism for multi-modal fusion
4. Create multi-task regression heads for developability metrics

### Phase 3: Generative Guidance
1. Adapt diffusion model from PRXLife approach for edit proposal
2. Implement biophysical constraints in generation process
3. Develop counterfactual search algorithm with generative guidance

### Phase 4: Training and Validation
1. Train on FLAb benchmark dataset (13,384 fitness metrics across 17 families)
2. Validate against experimental data for HIC, CHO, AC-SINS, Tm2, Titer
3. Test high-coherence vs. low-coherence candidates in silico

## Competitive Advantages
- Transform developability assessment from static to dynamic
- Provide actionable repair pathways for high-risk antibodies
- Enable rational design of next-generation therapeutics
- Create significant advantage in 2025 AbDev competition

## Confidence
0.86 - High confidence due to strong empirical basis in approved antibody data and recent methodological advances. Moderate uncertainty remains in generalization to rare isotypes and novel scaffolds.

## Strategic Importance
The enhanced MSED framework provides a significant competitive edge by incorporating isotype-specific biological constraints and state-of-the-art generative methods. This creates a more realistic and accurate model of antibody developability space, particularly valuable for differentiating between closely ranked candidates where small differences in repairability can have large development implications.
