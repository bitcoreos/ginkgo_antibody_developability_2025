**Task**: Generate citation for ensemble fusion methods in antibody developability prediction
**Status**: Completed
**Files Created**:

- Updated /a0/bitcore/workspace/bitcore_research/citation/citation_index.md

**Summary**: 
Added citation for AbLEF (Antibody Language Ensemble Fusion) study published in Bioinformatics (2024). This novel approach fuses multiple antibody language models to improve predictive performance for developability properties by explicitly integrating thermodynamic information into the latent space.

**Suggestions for Next Research Directions**:
1. Benchmark individual antibody language models (p-IgGen, AntiBERTy, Sapiens) on GDPa1 dataset
2. Compare different fusion strategies (concatenation, averaging, attention-based) for ensemble methods
3. Evaluate impact of thermodynamic feature integration on prediction accuracy
4. Investigate knowledge distillation approaches to create compact versions of ensemble models
5. Explore cross-attention fusion mechanisms for integrating structural, biophysical, and sequence sub-models
