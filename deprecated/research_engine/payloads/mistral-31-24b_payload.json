  "researchTopic": "Research the clinical aspects of hidden features in antibody sequences that influence developability. Focus on: real-world outcomes and applications. Key questions to address: How do developability metrics translate to clinical outcomes?, What are the real-world consequences of poor developability in therapeutic antibodies?, How do clinical requirements shape developability optimization?",
