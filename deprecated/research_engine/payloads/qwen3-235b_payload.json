  "researchTopic": "Research the thermodynamic aspects of hidden features in antibody sequences that influence developability. Focus on: energy landscapes governing folding. Key questions to address: What thermodynamic principles govern antibody folding and stability?, How do energy landscapes influence aggregation propensity and thermal stability?, Can we predict Tm2 and AC-SINS_pH7.4 from thermodynamic calculations?",
