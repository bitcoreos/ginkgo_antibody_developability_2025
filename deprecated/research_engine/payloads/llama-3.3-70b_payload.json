  "researchTopic": "Research the evolutionary aspects of hidden features in antibody sequences that influence developability. Focus on: patterns from natural selection. Key questions to address: What evolutionary patterns in antibody sequences indicate high developability?, How does natural selection shape sequences to avoid aggregation or instability?, Can we identify 'evolutionarily optimized' sequence patterns?",
