[{"response":[{"concept_mapper_response":"### Structured Glossary\n\n#### Key Terms and Definitions\n\n1. **Academic Discipline**\n   - **Definition**: A subdivision of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Academic disciplines are defined and recognized by academic journals, learned societies, and academic departments. Technical advancement in disciplines, specialized terminologies, and methodologies are used to communicate within and between disciplines [REF]0,9,10[/REF].\n   - **Usage**: Academic disciplines allow for in-depth exploration of specific subject areas, enabling students and researchers to focus on particular fields.\n   - **Related Terms**: Subject Area, Field of Study, Specialization.\n\n2. **Institution**\n   - **Definition**: A humanly devised structure of rules, norms, and beliefs that shape and constrain social behavior. Institutions include laws, rules, social conventions, and norms. They provide a framework of rules that are used as a reference for individuals, social groups, organizations. [REF]1[/REF]\n   - **Related Terms**: Organization, Institution Framework, Normative System\n   - **Example**: Academic institutions, such as universities, are examples of institutions that grant academic degrees and conduct research.\n   - **Example**: Technological developments play a crucial role in shaping the economic stability of institutions [REF] 1[/REF]\n\n3. **Interdisciplinary Studies**\n   - **Definition**: An integrated approach combining multiple academic disciplines to address complex problems. Interdisciplinary studies involve drawing knowledge from several fields, such as sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Interdisciplinary studies can become the focus of study.\n   - **Usage**: For instance, solving the problems of epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, or regarding climate change often require an interdisciplinary approach.\n   - **Related Terms**: Multidisciplinary Studies, Transdisciplinary Studies, Cross-disciplinary Research.\n\n4. **Goals**\n   - **Definition**: Broad learning concepts that describe what an institution aims to achieve through its educational programs. For example, clear communication, problem solving, and ethical awareness.\n   - **Related Terms**: Learning Outcomes, Educational Objectives\n   - **Example Use Case**: Maki's, 2004 \"Assessing for Learning: Building a sustainable commitment across the institution,\" imparted foundational frameworks of defining, evaluating, and achieving academic goals [REF]12[/REF].\n\n5. **Jargon Terms OR Terminoid**\n   - **Definition**: Specialized lexical units or phrases in a technical domain that are specific to phenomena not yet identified in a precise way. [REF]9[/REF]\n   - **Lay Usage**: Formal terms that are commonly used in a specific field that may carry an alternate but well-understood meaning in a lay context. For example, in computer science, \"bug\" refers to a software error or flaw, but in everyday language, a \"bug\" refers to an insect.\n   - **Example**: An interdisciplinary study of global warming would use jargon terms from various fields, such as climatology, biology, and environmental science.\n\n6. **Multidisciplinary Studies**\n   - **Definition**: An approach under which different disciplines are researched and combined to provide a comprehensive understanding of a particular topic. This approach, in contrast to interdisciplinary, primarily combines perspectives and then knits them into a structured approach rather than fully integrating knowledge across disciplines. [REF] 6 [/REF].\n   - **Related Terms**: Multidisciplinary Research.\n\n#### Conceptual Relationships\n\n1. **Academic Discipline vs. Institution**\n   - **Relationship**: Academic disciplines operate within institutions, which provide the structural framework for research and teaching.\n   - **Contextual Overlap**: Both terms involve specialized knowledge and systematic study, but institutions encompass broader organizational and societal structures.\n\n2. **Jargon Terms vs. Interdisciplinary Studies**\n   - **Relationship**: Jargon terms are often the result of interdisciplinary studies, as new concepts and phenomena emerge from the integration of multiple disciplines.\n   - **Example**: Terms like \"ecosystem health\" emerged from interdisciplinary studies combining ecology, public health, and environmental science.\n\n3. **Institution vs. Organization**\n   - **Relationship**: In an educational context, organizations are specific units (like schools or departments) within larger institutions (like universities), each with their own goals and operational structures. Institutions are more broad-based and have greater influence on societal norms and practices.\n\n4. **Interdisciplinary Research**\n    - **Example**: [REF]6[/REF] describes disciplined degrees of research available to integrated methods like IDR, MDR and TD goals.\n\n#### Usage Notes\n\n- **Lay Usage**: Terms like \"discipline\" and \"institution\" are often used broadly in everyday language to refer to systems of rules and structures, respectively.\n- **Academic Usage**: In academic contexts, these terms have more specific meanings related to specialized fields of study and formal structural frameworks.\n- **Technical Usage**: In technical fields, terms like \"jargon\" and \"multidisciplinary\" are used to describe specialized language and integrated approaches to research.\n\nThis glossary provides a clear and concise framework for understanding key terms and their relationships in the context of academic and institutional studies."},{"literature_investigator_response":"**Structured Glossary: Antibodies**\n\n### Core Terminology\n\n1. **Antibody**: A protein produced by the immune system to neutralize or remove pathogens, toxins, or other foreign substances [REF]0[/REF].\n2. **Antigen**: A substance that triggers the production of antibodies [REF]0[/REF].\n3. **Epitope**: The specific region on an antigen that an antibody binds to [REF]3[/REF].\n4. **Paratope**: The region on an antibody that binds to an epitope [REF]3[/REF].\n5. **Monoclonal antibody (mAb)**: An antibody produced by a single clone of cells, used for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes [REF]3[/REF].\n\n### Emerging Concepts\n\n1. **Bispecific antibody (BisAb)**: An antibody that binds to two different antigens or epitopes [REF]4[/REF].\n2. **T-cell engaging (TCE) antibody**: A BisAb that binds to a tumor antigen and a T-cell receptor, promoting T-cell-mediated killing [REF]4[/REF].\n3. **Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)**: An antibody linked to a cytotoxic drug, used for targeted cancer therapy [REF]7[/REF].\n4. **Generative foundation model**: A type of artificial intelligence (AI) model used for antibody design and engineering [REF]5[/REF].\n\n### Technical Usages\n\n1. **Kabat numbering system**: A method for numbering antibody sequences, used for comparative analysis [REF]0[/REF].\n2. **High-throughput experimentation**: A technique used for rapid testing and optimization of antibody properties [REF]1[/REF].\n3. **Machine learning**: A type of AI used for predicting antibody-antigen interactions and optimizing antibody design [REF]1[/REF].\n\n### Contextual Relationships\n\n1. **Antibody engineering**: The use of genetic and biochemical techniques to design and optimize antibodies for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes [REF]0[/REF].\n2. **Immunotherapy**: The use of antibodies and other immune system components to treat diseases, including cancer [REF]3[/REF].\n3. **Cancer therapy**: The use of antibodies, including ADCs and TCEs, to treat cancer [REF]7[/REF].\n\n### Competing Definitions\n\n1. **Antibody binding affinity**: The strength of binding between an antibody and its antigen, which can be measured using different methods [REF]2[/REF].\n2. **Antibody neutralization**: The ability of an antibody to neutralize or remove a pathogen or toxin, which can be measured using different assays [REF]2[/REF].\n\n### Usage Notes\n\n1. **Lay usage**: Antibodies are often referred to as \"proteins that fight infection\" or \"immunoglobulins\" in non-technical contexts.\n2. **Academic usage**: Antibodies are typically referred to as \"immunoglobulins\" or \"antigen-binding proteins\" in scientific literature.\n3. **Technical usage**: Antibodies are often referred to by their specific type (e.g., IgG, IgM) or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2) in technical contexts."},{"model_evaluator_response":null},{"empirical_landscape_response":null},{"conceptual_taxonomist_response":null},{"conceptual_taxonomist_response":"<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to construct an ontology for the field of mathematics. Let me start by recalling what an ontology is. It's a structured framework that defines entities, their relationships, and properties. The user specified that it should reflect how the field currently defines these things, so I need to make sure I'm sticking to established mathematical classifications.\n\nFirst, I should identify the core entities in mathematics. The main ones would be mathematical objects like numbers, sets, functions, and geometric shapes. Then, I need to think about their subtypes. For example, numbers can be integers, real numbers, complex numbers, etc. Sets have different types like empty sets, power sets, and unions. Functions can be linear, quadratic, or others. Geometry includes points, lines, planes, and solids.\n\nNext, relationships. In mathematics, entities interact through properties and relations. For instance, a function maps elements from one set to another. Sets can be subsets or supersets. Numbers can be related through inequalities or equations. Also, there's the concept of axioms and theorems, which are foundational and derived, respectively.\n\nHierarchical structure is important. So, I'll structure the ontology with a main root, maybe \"MathematicalEntity\", which is the top-level. Then, subentities under it. Each entity should have a definition and relations. For example, \"Number\" is a subtype of \"MathematicalEntity\", and \"Integer\" is a subtype of \"Number\".\n\nI need to make sure each node is clearly defined. For instance, \"Set\" is a collection of elements, and \"Function\" is a relation where each input has exactly one output. Also, relationships like \"is-a\", \"part-of\", \"interacts-with\" should be clearly labeled.\n\nWait, the user mentioned including hierarchical structure and brief definitions. So each entity should have a definition in the ontology tree. Let me check if I'm missing any key areas. Maybe include areas like algebra, calculus, geometry, and discrete mathematics. But the user said \"field\", so maybe focus on the broader mathematical entities rather than specific branches.\n\nAlso, relationships between entities. For example, a function interacts with sets through its domain and codomain. A geometric shape interacts with points and lines. I need to ensure that these relations are properly categorized.\n\nI should also think about the properties. For example, a prime number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. A continuous function is one where small changes in input result in small changes in output. These properties should be part of the ontology definitions.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that the ontology should be practical for data modeling and cross-disciplinary use. So the structure should be clear and not too specialized, allowing it to be used across different fields that interact with mathematics.\n\nLet me start building the ontology tree. Root is MathematicalEntity. Under that, Number, Set, Function, Geometry, Algebra, etc. Each of these has subtypes. For example, Number includes Integer, Real, Complex. Set includes Subset, Union, Intersection. Function includes Linear, Quadratic, Exponential.\n\nThen relationships: is-a (hierarchical), part-of (composition), interacts-with (relations between entities). For instance, a function interacts with its domain and codomain. A set interacts with its subsets.\n\nI need to make sure that all mathematical expressions are properly formatted with $$ delimiters. For example, when defining properties, equations should be in LaTeX format within the ontology.\n\nWait, the user also emphasized that the ontology should be concise and not include historical or speculative elements. So I need to stick to current classifications without going into historical developments.\n\nLet me check each node for clarity. For example, \"PrimeNumber\" is a subtype of \"Number\" with the property that it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. \"ContinuousFunction\" is a function where the domain is a subset of real numbers, and the function is continuous.\n\nI think that covers the main entities and their relationships. Now, structure this into the ontology tree with the required markdown format, ensuring each entity has a definition and relation types. Avoid any markdown in the thinking process, just the final answer.\n</think>\n\n```markdown\n# Mathematical Ontology\n\n## Root Entity: `MathematicalEntity`  \n**Definition**: Fundamental concept encompassing all mathematical objects, structures, and relations.  \n\n---\n\n### **Hierarchical Structure**  \n1. **Number**  \n   - **Subtype**: `Integer`  \n     - **Definition**: $$n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$ where $n$ is a whole number.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Set** (via subset relations).  \n   - **Subtype**: `RealNumber`  \n     - **Definition**: $$x \\in \\mathbb{R}$$ where $x$ is a point on the number line.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Function** (via domain/codomain).  \n   - **Subtype**: `ComplexNumber`  \n     - **Definition**: $$z = a + bi$$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $i^2 = -1$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Algebra** (via field extensions).  \n\n2. **Set**  \n   - **Subtype**: `EmptySet`  \n     - **Definition**: $$\\emptyset$$ (no elements).  \n     - **Relationship**: `is-a` **Subset** of all sets.  \n   - **Subtype**: `PowerSet`  \n     - **Definition**: $$\\mathcal{P}(A) = \\{x \\mid x \\subseteq A\\}$$ for set $A$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Function** (via characteristic functions).  \n   - **Subtype**: `Union`  \n     - **Definition**: $$\\bigcup A = \\{x \\mid \\exists a \\in A \\text{ s.t. } x \\in a\\}$$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `part-of` **Set Operations**.  \n\n3. **Function**  \n   - **Subtype**: `LinearFunction`  \n     - **Definition**: $$f(x) = mx + b$$ where $m, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Geometry** (via transformations).  \n   - **Subtype**: `QuadraticFunction`  \n     - **Definition**: $$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$ where $a \\neq 0$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Calculus** (via derivatives).  \n   - **Subtype**: `ExponentialFunction`  \n     - **Definition**: $$f(x) = ab^x$$ where $b > 0$.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Differential Equations**.  \n\n4. **Geometry**  \n   - **Subtype**: `Point`  \n     - **Definition**: $$P = (x, y)$$ in 2D space.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Line** (via collinearity).  \n   - **Subtype**: `Line`  \n     - **Definition**: $$y = mx + c$$ in 2D plane.  \n     - **Relationship**: `is-a` **Subset** of **Plane**.  \n   - **Subtype**: `Solid`  \n     - **Definition**: $$V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$$ for a cone.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Volume** (via measurements).  \n\n5. **Algebra**  \n   - **Subtype**: `Group`  \n     - **Definition**: $$G$$ with a binary operation satisfying closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.  \n     - **Relationship**: `interacts-with` **Number Theory** (via group structures).  \n   - **Subtype**: `Ring**  \n     - **Definition**: $$R$$ with two binary operations (addition, multiplication).  \n     - **Relationship**: `is-a` **Subset** of **Field** (if multiplicative inverses exist).  \n\n---\n\n## **Relations**  \n- **is-a**: Hierarchical inclusion (e.g., `QuadraticFunction` is-a `Function`).  \n- **part-of**: Composition (e.g., `Union` is part of `Set Operations`).  \n- **interacts-with**: Functional or structural relations (e.g., `Function` interacts-with `RealNumber` via domain).  \n\n---\n\n## **Key Properties**  \n- **Axiom**: Fundamental assumption (e.g., **Axiom of Choice** in set theory).  \n- **Theorem**: Derived conclusion (e.g., **Pythagorean Theorem**).  \n- **Identity**: $$a = a$$ (reflexive property).  \n- **Equality**: $$x = y \\iff \\forall P, P(x) \\iff P(y)$$ (definition of equality).  \n```"}]}]
