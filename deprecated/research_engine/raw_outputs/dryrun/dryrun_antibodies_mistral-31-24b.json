Let me start by reviewing the provided search results to gather the necessary terms.\n\nFirst, the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (2025) is mentioned. That's about classifying universities based on data from 2020-2023. Important terms here might be \"Institutional Classification,\" \"Carnegie Classification,\" and \"IPEDS data.\" Also, the 2025 update shifts to multidimensional categories, so terms like \"multidimensional categories\" and \"academic program concentration\" could be relevant.\n\nNext, the 2024-2025 Common Data Set (CDS) from MIT and other institutions. This includes data on graduation rates, degrees conferred, and costs of attendance. Terms like \"Common Data Set,\" \"Graduation Rates,\" \"Degrees Conferred,\" and \"Costs of Attendance\" need to be included. The academic year 2024-2025 is a key term here.\n\nThe academic year definition from Wikipedia mentions the structure of academic terms, breaks, and days. Terms like \"academic year,\" \"semesters,\" \"trimesters,\" and \"instructional days\" should be part of the glossary.\n\nThe Glossary of Academic Terminology from High Point University includes terms like \"academic advisor,\" \"accreditation,\" \"directory information,\" and \"instructor.\" These are important for defining roles and processes in academic institutions.\n\nMIT's 2023-24 CDS mentions net price calculators and costs for 2025-2026. Terms like \"net price calculator,\" \"costs of attendance,\" and \"tuition fees\" are relevant here. The academic year 2025-2026 is another key term.\n\nThe Glossary from Drexel University includes terms like \"assessment,\" \"accountability-oriented assessment,\" and \"learning outcomes,\" which are part of educational evaluation.\n\nThe academic institution definition from Wikipedia covers primary, secondary, college, and university levels. Terms like \"academic institution,\" \"university,\" \"college,\" and \"medical school\" should be included.\n\nThe academic discipline from Wikipedia discusses subdivisions of knowledge, like \"fields of study\" and \"departments,\" which are important for structuring academic offerings.\n\nThe Lynchburg College Glossary has terms like \"GPA,\" \"registration,\" \"transfer credits,\" and \"TOEFL,\" which are common in admissions and academic policies.\n\nThe University of Saint Joseph's glossary includes terms like \"academic advisor,\" \"academic alert,\" and \"community-based learning,\" which relate to student support and engagement.\n\nGrand Valley State University's glossary has terms like \"concentration,\" \"service-learning,\" and \"semester hour,\" which are part of academic structure and requirements.\n\nOregon State University's graduate education glossary includes terms like \"full-time equivalent,\" \"tuition waiver,\" and \"international student documentation,\" which are important for financial and administrative processes.\n\nThe Workday Terminology Talk about academic appointments explains terms like \"academic appointment,\" \"academic title,\" and \"fixed or indefinite term,\" which are relevant for faculty roles.\n\nThe Boise State College Terminology Glossary includes acronyms like RA, TA, ROTC, FAFSA, GRE, GPA, and others, which are part of college administrative and student support systems.\n\nNow, I need to organize these terms into a structured glossary, ensuring that each term is clearly defined, with relationships between them. For example, \"Institutional Classification\" relates to the Carnegie system, which uses data from IPEDS. \"Academic Year\" is a time frame that affects data collection for CDS. \"Academic Advisor\" is a role within the university, while \"Graduation Rates\" are part of the Common Data Set. There might be overlapping terms, like \"Costs of Attendance\" being part of both MIT's CDS and the academic year context.\n\nI should check for competing definitions. For instance, \"accreditation\" is defined as recognition of standards, but in different contexts, it might refer to specific agencies or processes. \"Academic Discipline\" is a field of study, but sometimes it's used to describe the structure of a university's departments.\n\nAlso, note that the academic year 2025-2026 is mentioned in multiple sources, so that's a key term to emphasize. Terms like \"Common Data Set\" (CDS) are part of the institutional reporting requirements. \"Institutional Classification\" is a broader category that includes various classifications based on data.\n\nI need to ensure that each definition is concise, and that the relationships between terms are clear. For example, \"Academic Advisor\" is a role that supports students in degree planning, which is part of the academic process. \"Graduation Rates\" are metrics collected as part of the CDS, which are used for benchmarking.\n\nAlso, terms like \"Academic Discipline\" and \"Academic Field\" are related but distinct. The former refers to the broader categories of study, while the latter might be more about the structure of departments.\n\nI should map out the relationships in a way that shows how terms connect. For instance, \"Institutional Classification\" is a system that uses \"Academic Year\" data to determine the classification. \"Common Data Set\" includes \"Graduation Rates\" and \"Costs of Attendance,\" which are part of the metrics collected.\n\nI need to avoid using markdown and ensure that all mathematical and chemical expressions are properly formatted. Since the user specified strict formatting rules, I must make sure that any mathematical terms are in double dollar signs. However, in this context, the main terms are academic and institutional, so there may not be much mathematical content. Still, I should check for any instances where mathematical expressions might be relevant, like in the definition of \"semester hour\" or \"credit-hour,\" but those are more about academic credits.\n\nFinally, the answer should be a structured glossary with definitions, relationships, and usage notes. I need to ensure that each term is clearly defined, with references to the sources where they were found, using the citation format provided. Any repeated information from multiple sources is cited once, and the first source is cited. All definitions should be concise, avoiding historical context unless necessary.\n</think>\n\n**Glossary of Academic and Institutional Terminology (2024–2025 Context)**  \n\n---\n\n### **Core Concepts**  \n1. **Academic Year**  \n   - **Definition**: A period (typically 12–18 months) during which students attend classes, complete coursework, and progress through a curriculum.
