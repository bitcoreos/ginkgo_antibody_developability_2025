              "content": "The concept of hidden features in antibody sequences that influence developability can be effectively analyzed using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [REF]8, 13, 14[/REF]. HMMs are statistical tools used to infer unobservable patterns and underlying states from sequences of observable events. In the context of antibody sequences, HMMs can help identify hidden features that impact developability, such as sequence-structure-function relationships, by analyzing the sequence data and predicting the probability of certain events or states [REF]3, 12[/REF].\n\nOne of the key applications of HMMs in antibody sequence analysis is in predicting disease susceptibility based on genetic sequences [REF]14[/REF]. For example, researchers can use HMMs to analyze genetic markers associated with diseases like cancer or heart disease, identifying patterns in DNA that suggest a higher risk for developing certain conditions. Additionally, HMMs can be used to model conserved protein domains across different organisms, predicting which genes are responsible for vital functions like antibiotic resistance [REF]14[/REF].\n\nIn the context of antibody developability, HMMs can be used to predict and optimize various properties relevant to developability, including affinity, cross-reactivity, and physicochemical stability [REF]0, 1, 2[/REF]. By integrating high-throughput experimentation and machine learning, data-driven methods can capture intricate sequence-structure-function relationships, enabling the rational design and optimization of therapeutic antibody candidates [REF]0, 2[/REF]. HMMs can also be used to identify sequence and structural characteristics that impact antibody aggregation and stability, informing the design of more developable antibodies [REF]11[/REF].\n\nThe use of HMMs in antibody sequence analysis has several benefits, including the ability to handle large datasets, identify complex patterns, and make predictions based on incomplete or noisy data [REF]8, 13[/REF]. Furthermore, HMMs can be combined with other machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of antibody design and optimization [REF]9, 10[/REF].\n\nTo illustrate the application of HMMs in antibody sequence analysis, consider the following example. Suppose we have a dataset of antibody sequences with known developability properties, such as affinity and stability. We can use an HMM to analyze the sequence data and predict the probability of certain events or states, such as the presence of specific amino acid residues or the formation of certain secondary structures [REF]3, 12[/REF]. By analyzing the output of the HMM, we can identify hidden features in the antibody sequences that influence developability and use this information to design and optimize new antibodies with improved developability properties.\n\nIn conclusion, HMMs are a powerful tool for analyzing hidden features in antibody sequences that influence developability. By integrating HMMs with other machine learning techniques and high-throughput experimentation, researchers can design and optimize therapeutic antibody candidates with improved developability properties, ultimately accelerating the development of novel therapies [REF]0, 2, 9[/REF].\n\n$$P(\\text{developability}|\\text{sequence}) = \\sum_{\\text{states}} P(\\text{state}|\\text{sequence}) \\times P(\\text{developability}|\\text{state})$$\n\nThis equation represents the probability of developability given a sequence, where the sum is taken over all possible states of the HMM. The first term, $P(\\text{state}|\\text{sequence})$, represents the probability of each state given the sequence, while the second term, $P(\\text{developability}|\\text{state})$, represents the probability of developability given each state. By analyzing the output of the HMM, we can identify the hidden features in the antibody sequences that influence developability and use this information to design and optimize new antibodies with improved developability properties.\n\n$$\\text{developability} = f(\\text{sequence}, \\text{structure}, \\text{function})$$\n\nThis equation represents the developability of an antibody as a function of its sequence, structure, and function.

By analyzing the sequence data using HMMs, we can identify hidden features in the antibody sequences that influence developability and use this information to design and optimize new antibodies with improved developability properties.\n\nIn terms of chemical formulas, the developability of an antibody can be represented as follows:\n\n$$\\text{developability} = f(\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3), \\text{H}_2\\text{O}, \\text{CO}_2, \\text{NaCl})$$\n\nThis equation represents the developability of an antibody as a function of its chemical composition, including the presence of specific amino acid residues, water, carbon dioxide, and sodium chloride. By analyzing the sequence data using HMMs, we can identify hidden features in the antibody sequences that influence developability and use this information to design and optimize new antibodies with improved developability properties.\n\n$$\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)$$\n\nThis equation represents the chemical formula for an amino acid residue, where $\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)$ represents a methyl group.

They mediate immune responses against foreign antigens and, in some cases, self-antigens. Over time, antibody-based technologies have evolved from monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), significantly impacting biotechnology, diagnostics, and therapeutics.\n\nThrough advanced data analysis, AI enables the prediction and design of antibody sequences, 3D structures, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), paratopes, epitopes, and antigen\u2013antibody interactions. These AI-powered innovations address longstanding challenges in antibody development, significantly improving speed, specificity, and accuracy in therapeutic design.\n\nEarly computational methods for antibody design were constrained by limited structural data and computational power, which hindered the development of reliable models for antibody-antigen interactions [19]. This led to inaccuracies in binding predictions, restricting their utility in guiding experimental design and necessitating extensive in vitro validation. As a result, researchers relied heavily on time-intensive and resource-intensive experimental approaches [19, 20].

Traditional antibody discovery and optimization methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, though they have successfully generated antibodies for diagnosing and treating diseases.\n\nIgFold can rapidly predict antibody structures using pre-trained language models and graph neural networks [16], and models like DiffAb can be used for the joint generation of antibody sequences and structures targeting CDR optimization [17]. Additionally, diffusion-based generative models and techniques like variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) accelerate the discovery of novel antibody variants [18,19]. This review focuses on the latest development of machine learning applications in antibody discovery and optimization.\n\nThese traditional antibody discovery methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive due to animal immunization and several cycles of screens. Traditional antibody discovery methods, such as phage display, are capable of screening millions to billions of antibody sequences, which is often sufficient to identify high-affinity antibodies with favorable developability attributes.\n\nIn contrast, machine learning approaches act as design methods, enabling the generation of novel antibody sequences that can access previously unexplored regions of this space, potentially uncovering more optimal candidates. However, exploring new sequence space also comes with unknown risks, including whether these antibodies will retain drug-like properties, favorable developability attributes, and low immunogenicity.",

The genie has some procedure to choose urns; the choice of the urn for the n-th ball depends only upon a random number and the choice of the urn for the (n \u2212 1)-th ball. The choice of urn does not directly depend on the urns chosen before this single previous urn; therefore, this is called a Markov process.\n\nThe Markov process cannot be observed, only the sequence of labeled balls, thus this arrangement is called a hidden Markov process. This is illustrated by the lower part of the diagram shown in Figure 1, where one can see that balls y1, y2, y3, y4 can be drawn at each state.\n\nSeveral inference problems are associated with hidden Markov models, as outlined below. The task is to compute in a best way, given the parameters of the model, the probability of a particular output sequence.\n\nThe task is usually to derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of the HMM given the set of output sequences. No tractable algorithm is known for solving this problem exactly, but a local maximum likelihood can be derived efficiently using the Baum\u2013Welch algorithm or the Baldi\u2013Chauvin algorithm. The Baum\u2013Welch algorithm is a special case of the expectation-maximization algorithm. If the HMMs are used for time series prediction, more sophisticated Bayesian inference methods, like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling are proven to be favorable over finding a single maximum likelihood model both in terms of accuracy and stability.\n\nHMMs can be applied in many fields where the goal is to recover a data sequence that is not immediately observable (but other data that depend on the sequence are).

These methods relied on sequence-based descriptors such as hydrophobic patches, charged residues, and coarse-grained structure-based features (Khetan et al., 2022).\n\nThis integration of DL-based docking, MD simulation, and high-performance computing provides a framework for the rational design of ADC\u2013glycan conjugates that meet structural and functional constraints, supporting the development of next-generation modular linkers with tunable therapeutic properties. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods represent an unexplored territory for de novo ADC design. Recent studies have demonstrated that RL frameworks can simulate iterative mutation and optimization cycles across antibody sequences, linker chemistries, and payload combinations.\n\nA notable advancement in this field is the emergence of generative AI frameworks specifically adapted for antibody engineering, which contributes to ADC development, as illustrated in Figure 4. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have generated diversified CDR loop libraries with enhanced antigen-binding potential. For example, PALM-H3, a recent GAN-based generative framework, was created for SARS-CoV-2 antibody studies, which enables the design of the CDR-H3 sequences conditioned on antibody structural context by learning potential representations that preserve loop geometry and canonical structural motif while also introducing functional diversity for antigen recognition (He et al., 2024).\n\nDevelopability assessments were another primary focus of traditional workflows.

These methods relied on sequence-based descriptors such as hydrophobic patches, charged residues, and coarse-grained structure-based features (Khetan et al., 2022).\n\nHowever, early developability models faced limitations due to small training datasets, narrow antibody diversity coverage, and lack of generalization across different payload-linker combinations. The absence of high-quality 3D structures further compounded these challenges, often forcing researchers to project predictions from fragmentary or homology-modeled structures from software like SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018). Despite these limitations, sequence-based models provided actionable insights into charge distribution, surface hydrophobicity, and isoelectric point, which remain relevant parameters in manufacturability risk assessment.",

We use this approach to develop hidden Markov models to decode the foraging behaviour of killer whales (Orcinus orca) off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Using cross-validated evaluation metrics and a detailed simulation study, we show that our weighted likelihood approach produces more accurate and understandable decoded latent processes compared to existing hidden Markov models and single-frame machine learning methods.\n\nAs such, we build off of current approaches for mixture models and develop a novel semi-supervised learning technique for HMMs. A mixture model is a simpler version of a hidden Markov model where the hidden states are modelled as independent categorical random variables instead of a Markov chain.

HMMs are designed to handle data that unfolds sequentially, allowing for insights into patterns and structures within such data.\n\nThese algorithms effectively \u201cdecode\u201d the hidden processes by considering all possible paths through the hidden states and their corresponding emissions, ultimately identifying the sequence that best explains the observed data. Hidden Markov Models are widely applied across various fields.\n\nThe \u201cMarkov\u201d component of an HMM refers to a Markov Chain, a mathematical system where the probability of the next event depends solely on the current state, not on the entire history of preceding events. This characteristic is known as the \u201cmemoryless\u201d property. In a Markov Chain, \u201cstates\u201d represent different situations or conditions, and \u201ctransition probabilities\u201d define the likelihood of moving from one state to another.\n\nThe \u201chidden\u201d aspect distinguishes an HMM from a simple Markov Chain, meaning the underlying states of the system cannot be directly observed. Instead, we observe outputs or emissions that are probabilistically linked to these hidden states.
