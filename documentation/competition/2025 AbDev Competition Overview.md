# 2025 Antibody Developability Competition Overview

**Source:** [Ginkgo Datapoints â€” 2025 AbDev Competition](https://datapoints.ginkgo.bio/ai-competitions/2025-abdev-competition#register)  
**Host:** Ginkgo Bioworks' Datapoints in collaboration with Hugging Face  
**Prize Pool:** Up to $60,000  
**Announcement:** Winners announced November 2025

## Competition Summary
The 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction Competition is an open benchmarking challenge focused on modeling key developability traits of therapeutic antibodies. Participants build and validate machine-learning models using the GDPa1 dataset and submit predictions on a private holdout set of 80 antibodies. The competition aims to accelerate AI-driven antibody engineering through shared datasets, transparent evaluations, and community engagement.

## Developability Properties
Submissions may target one or more of the following assays:
- ðŸ’§ **Hydrophobicity (HIC)**  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Polyreactivity (CHO)**  
- ðŸ§² **Self-association (AC-SINS at pH 7.4)**  
- ðŸ”¥ **Thermostability (Tm2)**  
- ðŸ§ª **Titer**

Each property has its own leaderboard and prize. Entrants can submit for any subset of properties.

## Recognition and Prizes
- Prizes awarded to the top predictors for each property on the private holdout set.  
- An **open-source prize** honors the best team that trains solely on the 246 public antibodies and releases reproducible code.  
- Submissions may remain anonymous publicly, but prize eligibility requires identity verification.

## Participation Steps
1. Create a Hugging Face account (if needed).  
2. Register a team via the Ginkgo Datapoints form (requires Hugging Face username).  
3. Build and validate predictive models using the GDPa1 dataset.  
4. Choose a validation track:  
   - **Track 1:** Submit predictions using an existing developability model on the GDPa1 public dataset.  
   - **Track 2:** Train a new model via cross-validation on GDPa1 and submit under the "Cross-validation" option.  
5. Upload predictions through the Hugging Face competition page using the unique code emailed after registration.

Participants are not required to submit predictions for all five properties.
