# Consolidation Plan for Literature Research Content

## Objective
Consolidate the 237 Markdown files in the literature_research directory into a smaller set of key presentation files in the final_presentation directory, reducing fragmentation while preserving important technical content.

## Key Technical Components to Consolidate
1. FLAb Framework
2. Multi-channel Information Theory Framework
3. AbLEF
4. Neural-ODEs
5. Cross-Attention Mechanisms
6. Graph Neural Networks
7. Implementation summary and gap analysis
8. Heavy-Light Coupling Analysis
9. Uncertainty Quantification
10. Ensemble Methods
11. Polyreactivity Analysis
12. Protein Language Models

## Approach
1. Enhance existing final_presentation files with consolidated technical content
2. Remove redundant files from literature_research directory
3. Update README.md to reflect the consolidated structure
4. Ensure all citations are properly maintained
