# BITCORE Modeling Framework

## Overview

BITCORE employs a sophisticated modeling framework that combines traditional machine learning with advanced techniques to predict antibody developability. The system primarily uses ensemble methods including Random Forest and XGBoost, with support for cross-validation and proper handling of missing data.

## Model Types

### 1. Random Forest

Random Forest is a robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

#### Implementation Details
- Script: `scripts/run_competition_modeling.py`
- Class: `ModifiedFeatureIntegration`
- Method: `train_random_forest_model()`
- Parameters: Default scikit-learn parameters with potential for hyperparameter tuning

#### Key Features
- Handles missing data through imputation
- Feature importance ranking
- Robust to overfitting
- Parallel processing capabilities

#### Training Process
1. Data preprocessing (imputation, scaling)
2. Feature selection
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Performance evaluation

#### Output
- File: `random_forest_model.joblib`
- Artifacts: Trained model, feature importance, cross-validation scores

### 2. XGBoost

XGBoost is a gradient boosting framework that provides high performance and flexibility.

#### Implementation Details
- Script: `scripts/run_competition_modeling.py`
- Class: `ModifiedFeatureIntegration`
- Method: `train_xgboost_model()`
- Parameters: Default XGBoost parameters with potential for hyperparameter tuning

#### Key Features
- Gradient boosting framework
- Regularization to prevent overfitting
- Handles sparse data efficiently
- Cross-platform compatibility

#### Training Process
1. Data preprocessing (imputation, scaling)
2. Feature selection
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Performance evaluation

#### Output
- File: `xgboost_model.joblib`
- Artifacts: Trained model, feature importance, cross-validation scores

## Model Training Framework

The model training framework provides a unified interface for training different model types.

### Key Components

#### FeatureIntegration Class
- Location: `scripts/feature_integration.py`
- Purpose: Centralized feature handling and model training
- Methods: `train_random_forest_model()`, `train_xgboost_model()`, `predict_with_model()`

#### Data Handling
- Imputation: Uses `SimpleImputer` and `IterativeImputer` for missing data
- Scaling: Uses `StandardScaler` for feature normalization
- Feature Selection: Automatic feature selection based on importance

#### Cross-Validation
- Method: Nested cross-validation with pre-assigned folds
- Purpose: Unbiased performance estimation
- Implementation: Custom cross-validation framework in modeling scripts

### Training Process

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load integrated feature matrix
   - Handle missing target values
   - Pre-select top features by correlation

2. **Pipeline Design**
   - Integrate imputation for missing feature values
   - Add feature selection to prevent overfitting
   - Implement standardization for proper scaling
   - Use appropriate regression model

3. **Cross-Validation Framework**
   - Use pre-assigned folds for outer CV loop
   - Implement inner CV for hyperparameter tuning
   - Evaluate model performance with multiple metrics

4. **Model Persistence**
   - Save trained models in joblib format
   - Store feature importance and performance metrics
   - Maintain model versioning

## Prediction Generation

Once models are trained, they are used to generate predictions for new data.

### Process
- Script: `scripts/generate_holdout_predictions.py`
- Method: Load trained model and apply to new feature matrix
- Output: Prediction values for target variable

### Key Components
- Model loading from joblib files
- Feature preprocessing using saved imputers and scalers
- Prediction generation with uncertainty quantification

## Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics to ensure robustness.

### Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R2) score
- Cross-validation scores
- Feature importance rankings

### Evaluation Process
- Script: `scripts/evaluate_model_performance.py`
- Method: Compare predictions against known targets
- Output: Performance metrics and visualizations

This modeling framework provides a solid foundation for accurate antibody developability prediction while maintaining flexibility to incorporate new methods and techniques.
