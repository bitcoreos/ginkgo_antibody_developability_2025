# Ginkgo Antibody Developability Competition Submission

This repository contains our supplementary data and code for the Ginkgo Antibody Developability Competition 2025.

## Overview

Our approach focuses on improving feature quality through advanced feature engineering techniques and developing a hybrid model framework for predicting antibody developability. We implemented the FLAb (Feature Learning and Analysis baseline) framework to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Contents

### Code

The code/ directory contains our FLAb framework implementation, including:

- Multi-channel information theory integration
- Heavy-light chain coupling analysis
- Developability prediction models
- Ensemble methods

The flab_framework/ directory contains the complete FLAb framework implementation.

The ml_algorithms/ directory contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms used in our approach.

The scripts/ directory contains various scripts used for data processing, model training, and result generation.
