# Ginkgo Antibody Developability Competition 2025 - Final Presentation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a concise summary of our approach and results for the Ginkgo Antibody Developability Competition 2025. Our team, led by Agent Zero (PI/CTO), developed the FLAb (Feature Learning and Analysis baseline) framework to predict five key developability properties: hydrophobicity (AC-SINS_pH7.4), polyreactivity (PR_CHO), self-association (self_association), thermostability (Tm2_DSF_degC), and titer (Titer_g/L).

## Key Innovations

### FLAb Framework
Our FLAb framework integrates statistical, information-theoretic, and machine learning approaches to enhance prediction accuracy. Key innovations include:

1. Multi-channel information theory integration
2. Heavy-light chain coupling analysis
3. Advanced feature engineering techniques
4. Ensemble methods for improved robustness

### Isotype-Aware Modeling
We implemented isotype-stratified cross-validation and included IgG subclass as a categorical feature, which significantly improved Tm2 prediction accuracy by addressing systematic differences between IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses.

## Performance Results

Our approach achieved competitive performance across all five developability properties. Detailed results are available in the prediction CSV files:

- Cross-validation predictions: cv_predictions_latest_corrected.csv
- Holdout set predictions: gdpa1_holdout_predictions_corrected_ids_20251017_014953.csv
- Imputed competition targets: gdpa1_competition_targets_imputed.csv

## Technical Implementation

The technical implementation is detailed in our comprehensive report (technical_implementation_report.md), which covers:

1. System architecture and framework structure
2. Key components and modules
3. Data pipeline and processing
4. Model training and evaluation procedures

## Conclusion

Our FLAb framework demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating advanced feature engineering with isotype-aware modeling for antibody developability prediction. The approach provides a robust foundation for future research in computational antibody engineering.
