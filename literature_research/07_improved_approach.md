# Improved Approach with Aggressive Feature Selection

## Overview
This document outlines an improved approach to address overfitting in the nested cross-validation implementation through aggressive feature selection and expanded parameter grids.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Aggressive Feature Selection
- Reduce feature set from ~211 to 30-150 features
- Use correlation with target for initial feature ranking
- Implement variance thresholding with higher threshold
- Consider mutual information-based feature selection

### 2. Expanded Parameter Grids
- Wider range of alpha values for Ridge regression: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]
- Add ElasticNet with combinations of alpha and l1_ratio
- Implement feature selection within pipeline for proper CV

### 3. Improved Pipeline Design
- Integrate feature selection within sklearn Pipeline
- Use SelectKBest or SelectPercentile for feature selection
- Ensure all preprocessing steps are properly nested within CV

## Implementation Details

### Feature Selection Strategy
1. Calculate correlation of each feature with target
2. Select top features by correlation (e.g., top 100)
3. Apply variance thresholding with higher threshold (0.05)
4. Use SelectKBest within pipeline for final feature selection

### Parameter Grids

#### Ridge Regression
- alpha: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]

#### ElasticNet
- alpha: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
- l1_ratio: [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]

#### Feature Selection
- k: [30, 50, 100, 150] (number of features to select)

## Pipeline Architecture

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, ElasticNet

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('feature_selection', SelectKBest(score_func=f_regression)),
    ('model', Ridge())
])
```

## Computational Considerations
- With expanded parameter grids, computation time will increase
- Use n_jobs=1 to manage resources
- Monitor memory usage during execution
- Consider early stopping if resource limits are exceeded

## Validation Improvements
- Add permutation tests to verify significance
- Implement learning curves to diagnose overfitting
- Compare to baseline models
- Track feature importance consistency

## Next Steps
1. Implement improved feature selection approach
2. Create enhanced pipeline with integrated feature selection
3. Define expanded parameter grids
4. Test with simplified implementation
5. Document results
6. Scale to full nested CV implementation
