# Systematic Pattern Recognition Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed documentation for the Systematic Pattern Recognition implementation. This module identifies problematic patterns in antibody sequences that may affect developability, including predefined motifs, homopolymers, charge clusters, and hydrophobic patches.

## Features

1. **Predefined Motif Identification**: Identification of known problematic sequence motifs
2. **Homopolymer Detection**: Detection of homopolymeric regions that may cause issues
3. **Charge Cluster Analysis**: Analysis of clusters of charged residues
4. **Hydrophobic Patch Detection**: Detection of hydrophobic patches that may affect solubility
5. **Risk Scoring**: Calculation of risk scores for identified patterns
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generation of detailed pattern recognition reports

## Implementation Details

### PatternRecognizer Class

The `PatternRecognizer` class is the core of the implementation:

```python
recognizer = PatternRecognizer()
```

#### Methods

- `identify_problematic_patterns(sequence)`: Identify problematic patterns in an antibody sequence
- `generate_pattern_report(sequence)`: Generate a comprehensive pattern recognition report

### Pattern Types

#### 1. Predefined Motifs

The implementation includes a database of predefined problematic motifs:

- "GGG": Glycine-rich regions associated with aggregation (risk score: 0.8)
- "CC": Cysteine pairs that may form incorrect disulfide bonds (risk score: 0.7)
- "DD": Aspartic acid pairs that may cause isomerization (risk score: 0.6)
- "NN": Asparagine pairs that may cause deamidation (risk score: 0.6)
- "PP": Proline pairs that may affect folding (risk score: 0.5)
- "MMM": Methionine-rich regions susceptible to oxidation (risk score: 0.7)
- "WWW": Tryptophan-rich regions associated with aggregation (risk score: 0.8)
- "FFFF": Phenylalanine-rich regions associated with aggregation (risk score: 0.8)
- "YYYY": Tyrosine-rich regions associated with aggregation (risk score: 0.7)
- "FR": Phe-Arg motifs associated with proteolytic cleavage (risk score: 0.6)
- "NG": Asn-Gly motifs associated with deamidation (risk score: 0.6)
- "DG": Asp-Gly motifs associated with isomerization (risk score: 0.6)

#### 2. Homopolymers

Detection of homopolymeric regions with a minimum length of 4 residues. Risk scores are calculated based on:
- Length of the homopolymer
- Amino acid type (aromatic residues, glycine, proline, cysteine, and methionine have higher risk)

#### 3. Charge Clusters

Detection of clusters of charged residues (DEKR) using a sliding window approach with a window size of 7 residues. A cluster is identified when at least 3 charged residues are found in the window.

#### 4. Hydrophobic Patches

Detection of hydrophobic patches (AILMFWV) using a sliding window approach with a window size of 8 residues. A patch is identified when at least 4 hydrophobic residues are found in the window.

### Risk Scoring System

Each identified pattern is assigned a risk score between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate higher risk:

- **Predefined Motifs**: Fixed risk scores based on known problematic nature
- **Homopolymers**: Base risk of 0.3, increased by length and amino acid type
- **Charge Clusters**: Based on density of charged residues in the window
- **Hydrophobic Patches**: Based on density of hydrophobic residues in the window

The total risk score is calculated as a weighted average of individual pattern risk scores, normalized to the 0-1 range.

### Risk Assessment Categories

- Total Risk Score < 0.2: Low risk - few or no problematic patterns identified
- Total Risk Score 0.2-0.4: Moderate risk - some potentially problematic patterns identified
- Total Risk Score 0.4-0.6: High risk - several problematic patterns identified
- Total Risk Score > 0.6: Very high risk - many problematic patterns identified

## Usage Example

```python
from src.pattern_recognition import PatternRecognizer

# Example sequence
sequence = "QVQLVESGGGVVQPGRSLRLSCAASGFTFSSYGMHWVRQAPGKGLEWVAYISSSGSTYYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARYYDYYAMDYWGQGTLVTVSS"

# Create recognizer
recognizer = PatternRecognizer()

# Generate comprehensive pattern report
pattern_report = recognizer.generate_pattern_report(sequence)

print(pattern_report['summary'])
```

## Integration with FLAb Framework

This implementation can be integrated with the existing FLAb framework by:

1. Adding pattern recognition features to the FragmentAnalyzer output
2. Using pattern risk scores as inputs to the DevelopabilityPredictor
3. Incorporating pattern recognition results into the OptimizationRecommender

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Models**: Training models to predict pattern risk scores
2. **Structural Data Integration**: Integration with structural data for more accurate pattern identification
3. **Experimental Validation**: Experimental validation of identified patterns
4. **Pattern Database Expansion**: Expansion of the predefined motif database with new findings
