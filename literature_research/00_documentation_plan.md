# Nested Cross-Validation Implementation Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach to documenting the nested cross-validation implementation for antibody developability prediction. Each step of the process will be meticulously documented in markdown files to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Plans Directory (`/docs/nested_cv_implementation/plans/`)
- `01_investigation_scope.md` - Scope and objectives of the investigation
- `02_data_preprocessing_plan.md` - Detailed plan for data preprocessing steps
- `03_pipeline_design.md` - Design of the leakage-proof pipeline
- `04_nested_cv_framework.md` - Framework for nested cross-validation
- `05_parameter_grids.md` - Definition of parameter grids for hyperparameter tuning
- `06_acceptance_criteria.md` - Acceptance gates and validation criteria

### 2. Execution Directory (`/docs/nested_cv_implementation/execution/`)
- `01_environment_setup.md` - Environment setup and dependencies
- `02_data_loading.md` - Data loading and initial exploration
- `03_preprocessing_steps.md` - Step-by-step preprocessing implementation
- `04_pipeline_construction.md` - Pipeline construction and validation
- `05_nested_cv_implementation.md` - Implementation of nested CV framework
- `06_testing_approach.md` - Approach for testing with limited resources

### 3. Results Directory (`/docs/nested_cv_implementation/results/`)
- `01_simplified_run_results.md` - Results from simplified test runs
- `02_full_implementation_results.md` - Results from full implementation (when available)
- `03_performance_metrics.md` - Detailed performance metrics analysis
- `04_best_parameters.md` - Analysis of best parameters selected

### 4. Analysis Directory (`/docs/nested_cv_implementation/analysis/`)
- `01_results_interpretation.md` - Interpretation of results
- `02_model_diagnostics.md` - Model diagnostics and validation
- `03_comparison_with_baselines.md` - Comparison with baseline models
- `04_recommendations.md` - Recommendations for model improvement

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Files will be numbered to indicate sequence
- Descriptive names that clearly indicate content
- All files in markdown format (.md)

### Content Standards
- Each file will have a clear objective
- Detailed methodology description
- Code snippets with explanations
- Results with proper formatting
- Conclusions and next steps

### Version Control
- All documentation will be committed to version control
- Changes will be tracked with meaningful commit messages
- Documentation will be updated in parallel with code changes

## Resource Management

### Computational Constraints
- Limited computational resources require careful orchestration
- Each task/pipeline must be carefully siloed
- Testing approach with simplified parameters before full implementation

### Execution Strategy
1. Document each step before implementation
2. Implement and test with simplified parameters
3. Document results and lessons learned
4. Scale up to full implementation
5. Document full results and analysis

## Next Steps
1. Create investigation scope document
2. Document data preprocessing plan
3. Design leakage-proof pipeline
4. Implement and test with simplified parameters
5. Document results and refine approach
6. Scale to full implementation
