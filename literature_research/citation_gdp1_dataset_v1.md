# Project Context
The BITCORE Antibody Research System is now incorporating the GDPa1 dataset published by Ginkgo Datapoints in May 2025. This research direction focuses on leveraging this standardized, high-quality dataset containing developability measurements for 246 IgGs across 10 assays, generated using Ginkgo's high-throughput PROPHET-Ab platform. The system will utilize this dataset for AI/ML model training to address the data scarcity problem in antibody developability prediction and establish benchmarks for the 2025 AbDev Competition.
