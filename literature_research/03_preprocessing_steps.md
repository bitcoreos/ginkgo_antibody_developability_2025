# Preprocessing Steps for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the preprocessing steps required for the antibody developability dataset based on initial data exploration.

## Dataset Characteristics
- Shape: (246, 390)
- Missing values: 117 total across 5 columns
- Low variance columns: 171 columns with variance < 0.01
- Duplicated columns: 65 columns
- Target variable missing values: 4 (AC-SINS), 53 (Tm2)
- Unique groups: 246 (one per sample)

## Required Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Low-Quality Feature Pruning
- Remove 65 duplicated columns
- Remove 171 columns with very low variance (< 0.01)
- Remove columns with excessive missing values (>50%)

### 2. Missing Value Handling
- Handle missing values in 5 columns with total of 117 missing values
- Target variables: AC-SINS (4 missing), Tm2 (53 missing)
- Strategy: Mean imputation for numerical features

### 3. Data Type Conversion
- Keep numerical features as-is (int64, float64)
- Exclude object columns (sequence data) from modeling
- Keep boolean columns

### 4. Feature Selection for Modeling
- Exclude object columns: antibody_id, cdr_h1_seq, cdr_h2_seq, cdr_h3_seq, cdr_l1_seq, cdr_l2_seq, cdr_l3_seq, predicted_isotype
- Focus on numerical features for modeling

### 5. Scaling
- Apply StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions
- Fit scaler only on training data in each CV fold

## Implementation Approach

### Leakage Prevention
- All preprocessing steps must be applied within CV folds
- No information from validation/test sets should influence training set preprocessing
- Scaler fitting and feature selection must occur only on training data

### Computational Efficiency
- With limited computational resources, preprocessing steps should be efficient
- Vectorized operations should be preferred over iterative approaches
- Memory usage should be monitored

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Identify Columns to Exclude
- Object columns that are not numerical
- Duplicated columns
- Low variance columns
- Columns with excessive missing values

### Step 2: Handle Missing Values
- For remaining numerical features with missing values:
  - Apply mean imputation
  - Calculate mean only from training data in each fold

### Step 3: Prepare Feature Matrix
- Select only numerical features for modeling
- Exclude sequence data and other object columns

### Step 4: Implement Scaling
- Use StandardScaler within CV framework
- Fit and transform only on training data

## Validation Approach
- Verify preprocessing steps with simplified test data
- Check that no data leakage occurs between folds
- Confirm that preprocessing maintains data integrity

## Next Steps
1. Implement simplified preprocessing pipeline
2. Test with small subset of data
3. Document implementation details
4. Scale to full preprocessing implementation
5. Validate leakage prevention measures
