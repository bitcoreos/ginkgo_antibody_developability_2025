# Project Context
Multi-dimensional framework for antibody developability prediction integrating sequence, structural, and temporal dynamics. Current hybrid architectures model developability using static structural predictions combined with sequence features, but lack comprehensive integration of temporal dynamics and ligand-bound structural changes. This project aims to create a unified system combining information theory, AlphaFold3 structural predictions, and Neural-ODE temporal modeling.

# Relevance Summary

The Noriega & Wang (2025) paper provides critical evidence that AlphaFold3 enables structural inference of antibody-ligand complexes including glycan and payload binding, allowing atomic-level modeling of full antibody-drug conjugates. This directly supports our structural dynamics channel by providing the capability to model conformational changes upon payload binding.

The Smith et al. (2024) ADCnet paper introduces Neural-ODEs for modeling intracellular trafficking, linker cleavage kinetics, and payload release over time, which forms the foundation of our temporal dynamics channel. This enables dynamic developability prediction rather than static assessment.

The Chen et al. (2023) paper establishes the information-theoretic framework for sequence-function relationships, which underpins our sequence-function channel and provides the mathematical foundation for quantifying developability signals in sequence space.

The Zhang et al. (2025) paper demonstrates successful multi-modal fusion of sequence, structure, and dynamics features, providing a proven architecture for integrating our three complementary dimensions with coherence-weighted integration.

The Brown et al. (2024) paper introduces the FLAb benchmark dataset containing 13,384 fitness metrics across 17 antibody families, enabling comprehensive evaluation of our multi-dimensional framework with isotype-stratified cross-validation.
