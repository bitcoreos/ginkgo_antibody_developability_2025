# Pipeline Design for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a leakage-proof pipeline for the nested cross-validation implementation in antibody developability prediction.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Input: Raw dataset with 390 features
- Steps:
  - Low-quality feature pruning
  - Missing value imputation
  - Data type conversion
  - Standardization (StandardScaler)
  - Variance thresholding
  - Correlation culling
- Output: Cleaned and preprocessed feature matrix

### 2. Feature Selection Pipeline
- Input: Preprocessed feature matrix
- Options:
  - PCA transformation
  - Mutual information-based feature selection
- Output: Reduced feature set

### 3. Model Pipeline
- Input: Selected features
- Models to implement:
  - Ridge regression
  - ElasticNet regression
  - XGBoost regression
  - RandomForest regression
- Output: Trained model with predictions

## Pipeline Integration

### sklearn Pipeline Integration
- Combine preprocessing, feature selection, and model training in sklearn Pipeline object
- Ensure all steps are properly sequenced
- Enable parameter tuning across all pipeline steps

### Leakage Prevention Measures
- All preprocessing steps applied within CV folds
- Feature selection performed only on training data
- No information leakage between folds
- GroupKFold splits maintained throughout

## Implementation Architecture

### Nested CV Structure
- Outer loop: GroupKFold for performance evaluation
- Inner loop: GroupKFold for hyperparameter tuning
- Both loops use same group identifiers to prevent leakage

### Parameter Grids
- Define parameter grids for each model type
- Include preprocessing parameters where applicable
- Balance grid complexity with computational constraints

### Model Validation
- Spearman correlation as primary metric
- Additional metrics: RMSE, MAE
- Permutation tests for feature importance
- Stability checks across folds

## Resource Management

### Memory Efficiency
- Use sparse matrices where appropriate
- Clean up intermediate objects after each fold
- Monitor memory usage during execution

### Computational Efficiency
- Parallel processing where possible
- Early stopping for iterative algorithms
- Simplified parameter grids for initial testing

## Error Handling

### Data Quality Issues
- Handle missing values gracefully
- Manage outliers in feature distributions
- Validate data types at each step

### Execution Failures
- Implement checkpointing for long-running processes
- Log errors with sufficient detail for debugging
- Provide informative error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each pipeline component independently
- Verify preprocessing steps maintain data integrity
- Confirm feature selection works as expected

### Integration Testing
- Test complete pipeline with simplified parameters
- Verify no data leakage between folds
- Confirm GroupKFold splits are maintained

## Next Steps
1. Implement simplified version of pipeline
2. Test with small subset of data
3. Document implementation details
4. Scale to full pipeline implementation
5. Validate leakage prevention measures
