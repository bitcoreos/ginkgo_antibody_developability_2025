Relevance Summary
This paper introduces AbLEF (Antibody Language Ensemble Fusion), a novel deep learning framework that fuses molecular members of the 3D conformational ensemble to improve predictive performance for antibody developability properties. The method explicitly integrates thermodynamic information into the latent space, addressing a key limitation of single-model approaches. By combining multiple antibody language models, AbLEF captures complementary information and reduces model-specific biases, offering a significant competitive advantage in the antibody competition. The approach is particularly valuable for predicting complex properties like HIC retention time and thermal stability, where single models often underperform.
