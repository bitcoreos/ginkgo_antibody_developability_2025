## Relevance Summary
1. This paper compares various hydrophobicity scales and scoring methods for predicting HIC retention times of antibodies. The findings indicate that scales optimized for HIC retention (Jain, Meek) or membrane transfer (Wimley-White) perform better than general scales. This directly supports the development of predictive models for the HIC parameter in the competition.

2. This study presents machine learning approaches to predict delayed retention of antibodies in HIC directly from amino acid sequences. The methodology provides a foundation for sequence-based prediction models that can be applied to the HIC parameter in the competition.

3. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning applications in antibody developability prediction, including HIC retention time prediction. It offers valuable context for the broader application of ML in antibody engineering.

4. This paper demonstrates the application of machine learning models to predict purification process fit of monoclonal antibodies, including HIC retention time prediction. The approach is relevant to the competition's focus on developability prediction.

5. This recent paper describes high-throughput surrogate assays for antibody hydrophobicity assessment, which is directly relevant to the HIC parameter in the competition. The methodology provides experimental context for HIC measurements.
