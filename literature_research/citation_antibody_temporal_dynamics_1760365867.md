# Relevance Summary

The AbODE framework provides a novel approach to antibody design using conjoined ODEs that can be adapted to model the temporal evolution of developability parameters. This aligns with our goal of creating a dynamic developability predictor that captures time-resolved behavior rather than treating developability as a static property. The continuous differential attention mechanism in AbODE can be integrated with our existing structure-based models to create the first dynamic developability predictor.

The ADCnet paper demonstrates successful application of Neural-ODEs to model ADC kinetics, including intracellular trafficking and payload release over time. This provides a validated framework that we can adapt to model the temporal degradation processes that affect key developability parameters like thermostability, aggregation, and viscosity. By incorporating these physics-informed temporal dynamics, we can significantly improve prediction accuracy and reduce experimental screening costs.
