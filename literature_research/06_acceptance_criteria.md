- Performance metrics correctly calculated and stored

### Gate 2: Simplified Testing
- Framework executes successfully with simplified parameter grids
- No errors or exceptions during execution
- Reasonable performance metrics produced
- Memory usage within acceptable limits
- Execution time reasonable for test scale

### Gate 3: Resource Management
- Memory usage monitored and controlled
- Checkpointing implemented for long-running processes
- Progress tracking functional
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms working

### Gate 4: Full Implementation
- Framework executes with full parameter grids
- All model types successfully trained and evaluated
- Comprehensive performance metrics generated
- Diagnostic outputs produced
- Results consistent with expectations

### Gate 5: Validation and Analysis
- Performance metrics show no evidence of data leakage
- Results stable across folds

- Model performance reasonable given dataset size
- Diagnostic checks completed and documented

## Validation Criteria

### Correctness Validation
- GroupKFold splits correctly implemented
- No data leakage between related samples
- Preprocessing applied correctly within folds
- Feature selection and model training properly sequenced
- Performance metrics calculated correctly

### Performance Validation
- Spearman correlation coefficient as primary metric
- Secondary metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) consistent with primary
- Performance stable across folds (low variance)
- Results comparable to baseline expectations
- No overfitting evident in performance estimates

### Resource Validation
- Memory usage within system limits
- Execution time reasonable for dataset size
- Disk space usage controlled
- Parallelization working as expected (if implemented)

### Output Validation
- All expected output files generated
- Output format consistent with requirements
- Results interpretable and well-documented
- Diagnostic information sufficient for analysis

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Individual components tested in isolation
- Preprocessing steps validated with test data
- Feature selection methods verified
- Model training and prediction validated

### Integration Testing
- Complete pipeline tested with simplified parameters
- Data flow through all components verified
- Cross-validation framework validated
- Output generation confirmed

### Validation Testing
- Leakage detection performed
- Performance metrics validated
- Stability assessment completed
- Results interpretation verified

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Spearman correlation coefficient > 0.2 (minimum acceptable)
- RMSE < 5.0 (dependent on target variable scale)
- MAE < 3.0 (dependent on target variable scale)
- Fold variance < 0.1 (for all metrics)

### Qualitative Metrics
- No evidence of data leakage in results
- Model behavior consistent with domain knowledge
- Feature importance patterns interpretable
- Results stable across different random seeds

## Failure Conditions

### Immediate Failures
- Framework crashes or throws unhandled exceptions
- Data leakage detected in results
- Performance metrics outside reasonable bounds
- Memory errors or resource exhaustion

### Progressive Failures
- Degrading performance across folds
- Inconsistent results with different parameters
- Unstable feature selection
- Poor convergence of iterative algorithms

## Recovery Procedures

### Error Handling
- Detailed logging of all errors and exceptions
- Checkpointing to resume from last successful fold
- Isolation of fold-specific issues
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Debugging Support
- Comprehensive logging of execution progress
- Intermediate results stored for analysis
- Diagnostic information captured
- Clear error messages for common issues
