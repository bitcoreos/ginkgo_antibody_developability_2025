# Relevance Summary

The AlphaFold3 paper provides the foundational architecture for predicting joint structures of antibody-ligand complexes, including glycans and payloads, enabling atomic-level modeling of full ADCs. This directly supports our multi-dimensional developability framework by providing accurate structural inference capabilities.

The Neural-ODE paper introduces a deep learning approach for modeling pharmacokinetic dynamics that can predict individual patient responses across different dosing regimens. This supports our dynamic fitness landscape framework by enabling temporal modeling of ADC behavior and optimizing dosing strategies.
