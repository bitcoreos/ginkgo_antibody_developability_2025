# Updated Pipeline Design for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the updated design of the pipeline for the nested cross-validation implementation in antibody developability prediction, reflecting the current implementation with improvements for handling missing values and submission generation.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- Input: Raw dataset with 390 features
- Steps:
- Low-quality feature pruning
- Missing value imputation
- Data type conversion
- Standardization (StandardScaler)
- Variance thresholding
- Correlation culling
- Output: Cleaned and preprocessed feature matrix

### 2. Feature Selection Pipeline
- Input: Preprocessed feature matrix
- Options:
- PCA transformation
- Mutual information-based feature selection
- Output: Reduced feature set

### 3. Model Pipeline
- Input: Selected features
- Models implemented:
- Ridge regression
- ElasticNet regression
- XGBoost regression
- RandomForest regression
- Output: Trained model with predictions

## Key Implementation Updates

### Modified Feature Integration
- **Class**: `ModifiedFeatureIntegration`
- **Purpose**: Handle missing target values without filtering samples
- **Implementation**: Retains all 246 samples and generates predictions for all antibodies by training only on non-missing targets while still predicting for those with missing values
- **Benefits**: Maintains data integrity and ensures complete submission files
- **Note**: This is now integrated into the main pipeline

### Native Missing Value Handling
- Uses native missing value handling in algorithms
- Avoids imputation of target values
- Produces reasonable predicted values for previously excluded antibodies

## Pipeline Integration

### sklearn Pipeline Integration
- Combine preprocessing, feature selection, and model training in sklearn Pipeline object
- Ensure all steps are properly sequenced
- Enable parameter tuning across all pipeline steps

### Leakage Prevention Measures
- All preprocessing steps applied within CV folds
- Feature selection performed only on training data
- No information leakage between folds
- GroupKFold splits maintained throughout

## Submission Process Integration

### Unified Submission Creation
- **Script**: `run_competition_pipeline_modified.py`
- **Purpose**: Generate both required submission files as part of the main pipeline
- **Files Generated**:
- Cross-validation submission (246 antibodies)
- Private test set submission (80 antibodies)

### Cross-Validation Submission
- Format: antibody_name, AC-SINS_pH7.4, Tm2, hierarchical_cluster_IgG_isotype_stratified_fold
- Merges complete predictions with fold information
- Uses -1 as default fold for antibodies without fold information

### Private Test Set Submission
- Format: antibody_name, fold, AC-SINS_pH7.4, Tm2
- Copied from template/user submission files
- Contains predictions for all 80 private test set antibodies

## Implementation Architecture

### Nested CV Structure
- Outer loop: GroupKFold for performance evaluation
- Inner loop: GroupKFold for hyperparameter tuning
- Both loops use same group identifiers to prevent leakage

### Parameter Grids
- Define parameter grids for each model type
- Include preprocessing parameters where applicable
- Balance grid complexity with computational constraints

### Model Validation
- Spearman correlation as primary metric
- Additional metrics: RMSE, MAE
- Permutation tests for feature importance
- Stability checks across folds

## Resource Management

### Memory Efficiency
- Use sparse matrices where appropriate
- Clean up intermediate objects after each fold
- Monitor memory usage during execution

### Computational Efficiency
- Parallel processing where possible
- Early stopping for iterative algorithms
- Simplified parameter grids for initial testing

## Error Handling

### Data Quality Issues
- Handle missing values gracefully with ModifiedFeatureIntegration
- Manage outliers in feature distributions
- Validate data types at each step

### Execution Failures
- Implement checkpointing for long-running processes
- Log errors with sufficient detail for debugging
- Provide informative error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each pipeline component independently
- Verify preprocessing steps maintain data integrity
- Confirm feature selection works as expected
- Validate ModifiedFeatureIntegration handles missing values correctly

## Implementation Status

### 1. Pipeline Implementation
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Main pipeline now uses ModifiedFeatureIntegration and generates predictions for all 246 antibodies
- **Location**: `scripts/run_competition_pipeline_modified.py`

### 2. File Location Accuracy
- **Status**: Corrected
- **Details**: All references now point to the correct file locations
- **Location**: ModifiedFeatureIntegration is in `scripts/modified_feature_integration.py`

### 3. Unified Pipeline
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**: Separate script approach has been integrated into the main pipeline
- **Location**: `scripts/run_pipeline.py` now calls `scripts/run_competition_pipeline_modified.py`
