## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Massive Feature Underutilization
- We have access to 383 features in our combined feature matrix
- Our modeling matrix is correctly reduced to 87 features
- However, our models were trained on only 3 features
- This represents a critical underutilization of available data

### 2. Incomplete Submission Process
- Our initial submission file was missing 91 antibodies
- We lacked proper validation to ensure all required antibodies were included
- There was no systematic approach to verify submission completeness

### 3. Underpowered Models
- Using only 3 features severely limits model performance
- We're not leveraging the sophisticated feature engineering we developed
- Our predictions are poor due to the limited feature set

## What Has Been Done So Far

### Critical Issues Fixed
- Fixed antibody ID mismatch in submission file (2025-10-16)
  - Identified root cause: Using P907-A14- format instead of GDPa1-### format
  - Created new heldout sequences file with correct GDPa1 IDs
  - Fixed structural features generation script
  - Regenerated structural features with correct IDs
  - Regenerated predictions with correct IDs
  - Created new dry run submission file with correct GDPa1 IDs
  - Verified: 80 rows with all GDPa1-### format antibody IDs (0 P907 IDs)

### Data Pipeline
- Successfully implemented MICE imputation for missing target data
- Validated approach through cross-validation
- Performance improvements:
  - Tm2_DSF_degC: RMSE +0.198, MAE +0.215 (most significant improvement)
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4_nmol/mg: RMSE +0.079, MAE +0.132
  - PR_CHO: RMSE +0.010, MAE +0.010
  - HIC_delta_G_ML: RMSE +0.006, MAE +0.003

  - Enhanced CDR features (170 features)
  - Aggregation propensity features (65 features)
  - Thermal stability features (133 features)
  - Mutual information features (7 features)
  - Isotype-specific features (13 features)
- Applied feature reduction to generate exactly 87 features:
  - CDR features reduced to 20 principal components
  - 6 MI features selected
  - 6 isotype features used
  - 55 other features selected based on variance
- Validation passed: 87 features generated as required

## What We're Planning to Do

### 1. Use Full Feature Set
- Retrain models using the complete 87-feature set
- Implement the advanced feature engineering described in our strategic plan
- Include CH1-CL interface stability scores, CDR region analysis, and biophysical features

### 2. Implement Systematic Validation
- Create validation scripts to ensure all antibodies are included in submissions
- Verify submission files against the complete antibody list
- Implement automated checks for required columns and data ranges

### 3. Develop Advanced Models
- Build the hybrid structural-sequential architecture using ESMFold
- Apply biological constraints to ensure predictions are within plausible ranges
- Use proper cross-validation with isotype-stratified folds
- Implement ensemble methods and calibration techniques

### 4. Improve Data Quality
- Apply missing data imputation strategies for incomplete assays
- Use domain knowledge to constrain predictions to biologically plausible ranges
- Implement quality checks for feature generation pipelines

## Verification of Current State

### Models
We currently have 5 trained Ridge regression models:
- ridge_model_AC-SINS_pH7.4.pkl
- ridge_model_PR_CHO.pkl
- ridge_model_HIC.pkl
- ridge_model_Titer.pkl
- ridge_model_Tm2.pkl

### Features
Our modeling feature matrix has exactly 87 features as validated by our feature integration pipeline, including:
- CDR features: 20
- Aggregation features: 10
- Thermal features: 5
- MI features: 6
- Isotype features: 6

This matches our strategic requirement of exactly 87 features for modeling.

### Data Quality
- No missing values in feature columns (all 87 features have complete data)
- Missing values only in target columns (expected):
  - PR_CHO: 49 missing (19.9%)
  - Tm2_DSF_degC: 53 missing (21.5%)
  - HIC_delta_G_ML: 4 missing (1.6%)
  - AC-SINS_pH7.4_nmol/mg: 4 missing (1.6%)
  - Titer_g/L: 7 missing (2.8%)

This confirms that our feature engineering pipeline is working correctly and we have the full feature set available for modeling.

### Data Quality

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Retrain Models with Full Feature Set**:
   - Modify the modeling pipeline to use the complete 87-feature set instead of the 3 basic structural features
   - Use the modeling_feature_matrix.csv which contains exactly 87 features as validated
   - Ensure all preprocessing steps (imputation, scaling) are applied correctly to all features
   - **CRITICAL**: Add missing IgG subclass (hc_subtype) and light chain subtype (lc_subtype) as categorical features
   - Properly encode categorical features (one-hot encoding for IgG subclasses)
   - Include IgG subclass as a required feature for Tm2 prediction as specified in strategic memory

2. **Implement Proper Cross-Validation**:
   - Use the hierarchical IgG-isotype stratified 5-fold splits as required
   - Ensure preprocessing pipelines are fitted on training folds only to prevent data leakage
   - Apply surprisal curriculum: begin with low-surprisal tiers, then unlock higher surprisal sequences after convergence checks

3. **Fix Model Architecture**:
   - Replace simple Ridge models with the planned sophisticated approach:
     - Gradient Boosted Trees on engineered features (baseline parity)
     - Multi-task Feedforward Network ingesting concatenated statistical + LM embeddings
     - Transformer fine-tuning for sequence-to-property prediction
     - Stacked ensemble governor combining multiple predictions

### Short-term Actions (Priority 2)

4. **Implement Calibration and Post-Processing**:
   - Apply temperature scaling per assay using validation fold
   - Implement quantile mapping for Titer to align with historical distribution
   - Add proper uncertainty quantification

5. **Complete Submission Validation**:
   - Create validation scripts to ensure all 246 antibodies are included in cross-validation predictions
   - Verify submission files against the complete antibody list
   - Implement automated checks for required columns and data ranges

6. **Generate New Predictions**:
   - Generate cross-validation predictions using the improved models
   - Generate holdout set predictions with proper formatting
   - Apply biological constraints to ensure predictions are within plausible ranges

### Long-term Actions (Priority 3)

7. **Implement Advanced Techniques**:
   - Add transfer learning capabilities
   - Implement physics-based or knowledge-guided models
   - Integrate structural adapters once IgFold licensing is resolved

8. **Documentation and Reproducibility**:
   - Capture deterministic seeds for full reproducibility
   - Maintain environment manifests for each run
   - Update semantic mesh with new artifacts and validators

## Risk Assessment
