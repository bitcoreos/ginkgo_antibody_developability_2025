# Relevance Summary

1. This study presents a comprehensive computational pipeline that integrates physics-based modeling and AI methods to design therapeutic antibodies with improved developability. It demonstrates experimental validation through SPR, SEC, thermostability measurements, and cryo-EM, confirming the effectiveness of multi-dimensional prediction approaches. The orthogonal design strategies (OAS scanning, inverse folding, language model-based evolution) enable efficient traversal of antibody sequence landscapes while maintaining binding functionality.

2. This article highlights the advancement of AlphaFold3 in modeling antibody-ligand complexes at atomic resolution, enabling *in silico* evaluation of conjugation strategies and epitope accessibility. It discusses the integration of molecular dynamics simulations and AI/ML models to understand ADC conformational variability and linker strain. The mention of Neural-ODEs in ADCnet supports the simulation of nonlinear kinetics in lysosomal degradation pathways, validating the temporal dynamics channel of the multi-dimensional framework.
