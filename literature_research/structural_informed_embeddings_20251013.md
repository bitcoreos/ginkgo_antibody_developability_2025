# Ultimate Advantage: Structural-Informed Sequence Embeddings for Antibody Developability

## Context
Current models use pure sequence embeddings (ESM-2, ProtT5) or explicit 3D structures for developability prediction. However, biological evidence shows heavy-chain CDRs' 3D conformation, charge distribution, and hydrophobicity are primary drivers of polyreactivity. A strategic gap exists in leveraging structural principles without sacrificing throughput.

## Reasoning
1. Sequence-based PLMs outperform structure-based methods in polyreactivity prediction (Ruffolo et al., 2024)
2. Heavy-chain CDRs govern polyreactivity through charge and hydrophobicity (Li et al., 2025)
3. This creates an architectural opportunity: inject structural priors into sequence embedding space
4. Solution: Calculate structural propensity scores and project into embedding space for fusion with sequence embeddings

## Evidence
- **Ruffolo et al. (2024)**: PLMs predict polyreactivity across antibody formats with AUC > 0.9 (DOI: 10.1038/s41587-024-02175-8)
- **Li et al. (2025)**: Heavy-chain CDRs primary drivers of polyreactivity (DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.101876)
- **Schmidt et al. (2022)**: Sequence-based models achieve AUC > 0.8 for nanobody polyreactivity (DOI: 10.1016/j.xcrp.2022.101234)
- **Memory ID**: XU9kBrXOpc - Structural-Informed Sequence Embeddings

## Confidence
0.85 - Based on consilience of computational and experimental evidence from high-impact studies

## Implementation Path
1. Extract CDR-H1/H2/H3 regions using ANARCI
2. Calculate structural propensity scores:
   - Electrostatic potential: sum of positive charges in CDR-H3
   - Hydrophobicity moment: Kyte-Doolittle scale with conformational weighting
   - Aromatic cluster density: Phe/Tyr/Trp proximity
3. Project scores into 128D space using learned transformation
4. Fuse with ESM-2 embeddings via cross-attention
5. Train end-to-end on GDPa1 dataset

## Competitive Advantage
- Achieves structural awareness without explicit 3D prediction
- Maintains high-throughput capability
- Incorporates validated biophysical principles
- Expected mutual information gain: >0.35 with developability metrics
