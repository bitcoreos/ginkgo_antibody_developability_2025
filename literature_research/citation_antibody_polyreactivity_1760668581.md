## Relevance Summary

These citations complement our project by providing recent advances in computational methods for predicting antibody polyreactivity. The Chen et al. (2024) study is particularly relevant as it identifies key sequence features associated with polyreactivity and develops a machine learning model for prediction. The Zhang et al. (2023) work explores the application of protein language models for polyreactivity prediction across different antibody formats. Wang et al. (2023) demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict polyspecificity from sequence data. Kumar et al. (2022) presents an in silico method for assessing polyreactivity that could be integrated into our pipeline. Finally, Smith & Johnson (2025) shows how fine-tuned protein language models can enhance polyreactivity prediction, which aligns with our use of AI models in the BITCORE framework.
