## Relevance Summary
1. This paper evaluates pre-trained language models and supervised convolutional neural networks for predicting antibody thermostability. The findings show that both approaches can effectively predict thermostability, with supervised models performing better on out-of-distribution datasets. This directly supports the development of models for the Tm2 parameter in the competition.

2. This paper describes a high-throughput differential scanning fluorescence assay for measuring antibody thermostability. The methodology provides important experimental context for the Tm2 measurements in the competition data and validates the importance of thermostability in antibody developability.
