# Simplified Test Run Results

## Overview
This document describes the results from the simplified test run of the preprocessing pipeline and basic model training.

## Test Setup
- Dataset: modeling_feature_matrix_with_enhanced_cdr.csv
- Samples: 242 (after removing 4 samples with missing target values)
- Initial features: 378 numerical features
- Excluded columns: antibody_id, CDR sequences, predicted_isotype, fold, Tm2_DSF_degC
- Target variable: AC-SINS_pH7.4_nmol/mg
- Grouping variable: antibody_id

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Removed samples with missing target values (4 samples)
2. Selected only numerical features for modeling
3. Applied variance thresholding (threshold = 0.01)
4. Applied standard scaling

## Results

### Data Dimensions
- Original feature matrix: (242, 378)
- After variance thresholding: (242, 211)
- Features removed: 167 (44.2%)

### Model Performance
- Train/test split: 80%/20% based on groups
- Train set size: 193 samples
- Test set size: 49 samples
- Model: Ridge regression (alpha = 1.0)

### Performance Metrics
- RMSE: 0.8525
- MAE: 0.7190
- Spearman correlation: 0.9568

## Analysis

### Preprocessing Effectiveness
- Variance thresholding successfully removed low-quality features
- Standard scaling normalized feature distributions
- No errors encountered during preprocessing

### Model Performance
- High Spearman correlation (0.9568) suggests strong predictive performance
- However, this may indicate overfitting given the small dataset size
- RMSE and MAE values are relatively low

### Validation
- Preprocessing pipeline executed without errors
- Model training and prediction completed successfully
- Performance metrics calculated correctly

## Next Steps
1. Implement nested cross-validation framework
2. Add hyperparameter tuning within CV framework
3. Validate that no data leakage occurs
4. Compare performance across multiple model types
5. Scale to full feature set and parameter grids
