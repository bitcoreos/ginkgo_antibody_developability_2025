# Relevance Summary
This comprehensive review in Nature covers the multifaceted molecular interactions and mechanisms underlying ADC pharmacokinetics, distribution and in vivo efficacy. It provides critical insights for guiding the rational design of next-generation ADCs by elucidating how molecular and immunological factors influence therapeutic outcomes. The paper's analysis of in vivo behavior fills a key gap in our current research coverage, particularly regarding the translation of in vitro findings to clinical efficacy.
