# Relevance Summary

1. Phan et al. (2022) describes the development of PEG-stabilized self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy (PS-SINS), which enables AC-SINS screening in various formulation conditions including those relevant to pH 7.4. This work directly addresses the technical challenges of implementing AC-SINS in different buffer systems, which is critical for understanding how to optimize the assay for the specific pH 7.4 conditions used in the 2025 competition.

2. Avery et al. (2018) explores correlations between in vitro physiochemical properties and in vivo human pharmacokinetics, with AC-SINS showing a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.7 between assay score and observed clearance. This demonstrates the clinical relevance of AC-SINS measurements and their importance in predicting antibody behavior in vivo, which is a key consideration for developability assessment.

3. Jones et al. (2019) developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic prediction model that incorporates nonspecific interaction aspects of antibodies represented by AC-SINS data. This work shows how AC-SINS data can be integrated into computational models to predict antibody behavior, which is directly relevant to the machine learning approaches being developed for the 2025 competition.

4. Starr et al. (2021) describes ultradilute measurements of self-association that can identify antibodies with favorable high-concentration solution properties. This work is relevant as it provides alternative approaches to measuring self-association that complement AC-SINS, and helps contextualize the importance of self-association measurements in predicting antibody behavior at high concentrations relevant to therapeutic formulations.

5. Mieczkowski et al. (2021) provides detailed characterization and modeling of reversible antibody self-association, offering insights into the behavior, prediction, and correction of self-association phenomena. This work is particularly relevant as it provides theoretical and practical frameworks for understanding the molecular basis of self-association, which can inform the development of predictive models for the competition.
