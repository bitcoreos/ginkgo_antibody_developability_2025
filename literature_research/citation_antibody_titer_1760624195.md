## Relevance Summary
These citations provide foundational knowledge about antibody titer measurement, particularly in the context of expression levels and longitudinal analysis. They cover various aspects of titer measurement including quantitative reporting, longitudinal analysis after vaccination, durability studies, and high-throughput platforms for neutralization titer determination. They are directly relevant to developing predictive models for the 2025 AbDev Competition, particularly for the Titer parameter which is one of the five key developability properties being evaluated.
