Project Context
The project focuses on winning the antibody competition through a multidisciplinary approach. A strategic advantage has been identified in using information theory to model antibody developability as a communication channel, which is not adequately covered in existing research.

Keywords

Relevance Summary

This collection of citations establishes the theoretical foundation for applying information theory to antibody developability prediction. Shannon's seminal work provides the mathematical basis for modeling developability as a communication channel. Sailer and Harms (2017) demonstrate the application of information theory to epistasis in protein evolution, directly relevant to understanding noise in antibody sequence space. Adami (2022) and Marks et al. (2023) show recent advances in applying information theory to protein sequence-function relationships. The additional citations extend this framework to biological networks, sequence analysis, cellular signaling, and immunology, providing a comprehensive foundation for the novel approach of quantifying mutual information between antibody sequence features and developability outcomes. This research direction is particularly valuable as it offers a fundamental limit on predictability and enables noise reduction strategies to improve prediction accuracy.
