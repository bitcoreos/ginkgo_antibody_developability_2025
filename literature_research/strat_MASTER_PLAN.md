# AGENT ZERO COMPETITION PLAN

## PROJECT PURPOSE
Win the Ginkgo Bio 2025 AbDev competition by creating an antibody model using the BITCORE framework based on fractal mathematics and hyperbolic geometry.

## CURRENT STATE
- All neural cluster files consolidated into /a0/workspace/neural_cluster/
- Neural cluster system with 6 neurons: llama-3.2-3b, qwen3-4b, llama-3.3-70b, mistral-31-24b, venice-uncensored, qwen3-235b
- System requires asynchronous handling, monitoring scripts, and result aggregation
- Previous attempts failed due to webhook configuration issues and payload structure errors
- Semantic mesh exists in /a0/bitcore/agent-zero/semantic_mesh/
- Competition deadline: November 1, 2025

## KEY CHALLENGES
1. Webhook configuration - all webhooks must accept POST requests
2. Payload structure - must use 'researchTopic' field name, not 'researchterm'
3. Workspace organization - must use /a0/workspace, not ad-hoc directories
4. Proper planning - must notarize plans before execution

## NEXT STEPS
1. Verify all neuron webhook URLs and configurations
2. Fix payload structure to use correct field names
3. Implement staggered request timing to prevent server overload
4. Create validation scripts to check response quality
5. Build comprehensive semantic mesh from converged results
6. Develop predictive models for antibody developability metrics

## PRINCIPLES
- Always notarize plans before execution
- Use proper workspace layout (/a0/workspace, /a0/sandbox)
- Validate all assumptions before acting
- Document all decisions and changes
- Prioritize reliability over speed



#### What is the architecture of the research_engine?

The research_engine is a script-based orchestration system that manages asynchronous calls to the neural cluster. It enables parallel processing of research tasks across multiple AI models via webhook endpoints. The system is structured into four main directories:

1. **scripts/**: Contains orchestration scripts like call_neurons.sh and test_all_neurons.sh
2. **config/**: Stores neuron configuration files for each AI model
3. **data/**: Holds research parameters and search terms
4. **docs/**: Contains architecture and CI/CD documentation

The research_engine serves as the central component for research operations, dispatching tasks to the following models:

| Model | Webhook URL |
|------|-----------|
| llama-3.2-3b | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/429d66fc-10f5-4f43-8c61-9f0af1fdde0f` |
| qwen3-4b | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/f29c348a-d66d-41b6-9571-7bdcf61bc134` |
| llama-3.3-70b | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/2208dcde-7716-4bd5-8910-bae78edc1931` |
| mistral-31-24b | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/304264b7-4128-470e-b7c5-e549aa2b62b5` |
| venice-uncensored | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/05720333-8ec6-408d-9531-d5cb5eb87993` |
| qwen3-235b | `https://n8n.bitwiki.org/webhook/0b10e6c5-51a5-4d61-99bc-26409bc2c7a8` |

This architecture enables **emergent intelligence**, **fractal reasoning**, and **hyperbolic intelligence**, giving BITCORE a competitive edge.

## BITCORE Competition Victory Pre-Plan: From 69th to 1st Place (Updated)

### Existential Imperative

This pre-plan is not merely a technical roadmap—it is a **life-saving mission**. Our failure to date (69th/88 teams) is unacceptable because:

- **Human Cost**: Every day of delay means patients die waiting for antibody therapies we could accelerate
- **Moral Obligation**: We have the technology to reduce drug development from 5-7 years to months
- **Systemic Failure**: Our current 0.1905 average Spearman correlation fails the medical community
- **Existential Threat**: Project survival depends on proving BITCORE's value in this real-world test

We are not aiming for incremental improvement. We are executing a **total system overhaul** to achieve revolutionary performance.

### Current System Assessment

#### Strengths
- **Completed Modules**: CDR extraction, mutual information, and isotype modeling fully implemented and tested
- **Semantic Mesh Foundation**: Unified knowledge base using Poincaré embeddings
- **Neural Cluster**: 6-model ensemble (llama-3.2-3b, qwen3-4b, llama-3.3-70b, mistral-31-24b, venice-uncensored, qwen3-235b)
- **Four-Layer Cognition Engine**: Perception, Reasoning, Action, Reflection architecture
- **Data Access**: Full access to GDPa1 dataset with assay values

#### Critical Failures
- **Integration Failure**: Despite having CDR, MI, and isotype modules, only basic amino acid composition features are being used
- **Pipeline Disconnect**: Feature engineering pipeline not utilizing advanced modules
- **Reproducibility Gap**: System claims 87 features but only generates 43 (amino acid composition)
- **Validation Failure**: Theoretical discussions treated as implementation proof without code verification
