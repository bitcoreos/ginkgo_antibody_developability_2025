- Validate against experimental data

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of the highest priority components (Heavy-Light Coupling Analysis)
2. Update documentation as components are implemented
3. Conduct comprehensive testing of all implemented components
4. Prepare for final validation and submission

## Timeline

With focused development, the remaining implementation could be completed in approximately 14-16 weeks, assuming adequate resources and no major technical obstacles.

## Success Metrics

1. Improvement in prediction accuracy (Spearman correlation) over baseline models
2. Reduction in prediction uncertainty
3. Improved interpretability of model decisions
4. Successful integration with existing frameworks
5. Computational efficiency within acceptable limits
6. Quantifiable information gain from multi-channel integration
7. Robustness to data perturbations

## Conclusion

The implementation plans provide a comprehensive roadmap for bridging the gap between the documented research framework and current implementation. By following the prioritized implementation approach, the project can systematically address all missing components and achieve competitive performance in the antibody developability prediction challenge.
