# Relevance Summary
1. This Nature Communications paper reveals how a recurring CDR H3 motif enables broad protection against influenza by targeting neuraminidase. The structural insights provide a template for designing universal flu vaccines and demonstrate how specific CDR H3 configurations confer cross-reactivity.

2. This PLOS One study benchmarks inverse folding models for CDR sequence design, providing quantitative performance metrics for AI-driven antibody engineering. The findings guide model selection for CDR optimization tasks and establish benchmarks for future method development in computational antibody design.

3. This Biomarker Research article demonstrates how AI transforms oncology through intelligent antibody design. The paper shows how machine learning optimizes CDR sequences for cancer targets, improving binding affinity and reducing off-target effects, with direct implications for therapeutic antibody development.

4. This bioRxiv preprint introduces a deep learning method to predict CDR conformational flexibility, a key determinant of antigen binding. The model enables early assessment of developability risks by identifying CDRs prone to structural instability, allowing for proactive sequence optimization before experimental validation.

5. This Communications Biology study characterizes ultra-long CDR H3 antibodies that use conserved cysteines for antigen recognition in infectious diseases. The work expands the known structural repertoire of CDR H3 loops and identifies a novel mechanism for pathogen neutralization with implications for vaccine design.
