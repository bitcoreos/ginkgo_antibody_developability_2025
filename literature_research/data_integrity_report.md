# Data Integrity Report - October 18, 2025

## Issues Identified
1. Heldout set file contained extra duplicated column
2. File hash mismatch: 0e80b563... vs. correct: cab33837...
3. All model work between Oct 11-16 used incorrect data

## Corrective Actions
1. Restored original heldout-set-sequences.csv from backup
2. Verified file hash now matches original competition file
3. Created validation script at /a0/bitcore/workspace/scripts/validation/validate_workspace.sh

## Current Status
- GDPa1_v1.2_sequences.csv: VALID
- heldout-set-sequences.csv: VALID
- MANIFEST.yaml: VALID

## Work That Needs Redone
1. Feature engineering for heldout set
2. Model training and predictions
3. Submission file generation
4. All analysis based on previous model outputs

## Recommendations
1. Implement mandatory validation before processing
2. Establish breadcrumb trail for file modifications
3. Create automated alerts for data integrity violations
