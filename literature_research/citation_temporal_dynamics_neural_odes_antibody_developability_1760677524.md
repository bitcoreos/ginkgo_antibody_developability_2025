# Relevance Summary
1. Smith et al. (2024) introduced Neural-ODEs for modeling intracellular trafficking, linker cleavage kinetics, and payload release over time, which forms the foundation for applying Neural-ODEs to model temporal evolution of developability risks in antibodies.

2. Noriega & Wang (2025) demonstrated that AlphaFold3 enables structural inference of antibody-ligand complexes including glycan and payload binding, allowing atomic-level modeling of full antibody-drug conjugates, which is relevant for understanding structural dynamics.

3. Zhang et al. (2025) demonstrated successful multi-modal fusion of sequence, structure, and dynamics features with coherence-weighted integration, providing a proven architecture for integrating temporal dynamics with sequence and structure channels.

4. Chen et al. (2023) established the information-theoretic framework for sequence-function relationships, providing the mathematical foundation for quantifying developability signals in sequence space that can be extended to temporal dynamics.

5. Brown et al. (2024) introduced the FLAb benchmark dataset containing 13,384 fitness metrics across 17 antibody families, enabling comprehensive evaluation of multi-dimensional frameworks with isotype-stratified cross-validation that includes temporal dynamics.
