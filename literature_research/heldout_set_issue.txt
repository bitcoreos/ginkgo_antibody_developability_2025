# Heldout Set Data Issue

## Problem
The heldout set file contained an extra duplicated column.

## Root Cause
An unknown processing step added an antibody_name column.

## Impact

## Evidence
File hash mismatch: 0e80b563... vs. correct: cab33837...

## Resolution
File restored from backup on 2025-10-18.
