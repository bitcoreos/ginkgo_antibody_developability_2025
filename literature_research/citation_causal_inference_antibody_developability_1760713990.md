Project Context
The antibody developability prediction project aims to leverage machine learning and computational methods to predict key properties of therapeutic antibodies that impact their developability. While existing approaches primarily focus on correlation-based predictive models, there is significant potential in applying causal inference methods to identify true causal relationships between antibody features and developability properties. This approach could lead to more robust and interpretable models that better inform antibody design decisions.
