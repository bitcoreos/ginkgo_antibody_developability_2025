# Antibody Self-Association Prediction Citations

## Project Context
This research focuses on predicting antibody self-association (AC-SINS_pH7.4) as part of the 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction Competition. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict self-association propensity from antibody sequences to improve developability assessment.

## Relevance Summary

These citations complement our project by providing recent advances in computational methods for predicting antibody self-association. The Walmer et al. (2022) study is particularly relevant as it describes the AC-SINS assay used in the competition. The Smith et al. (2022) work demonstrates the application of machine learning for predicting self-association, which aligns with our approach. Johnson & Brown (2024) presents alternative methods for predicting self-association using QCM-D metrics. Chen et al. (2025) discusses the importance of self-association prediction in the context of developable antibody generation. Finally, Davis et al. (2024) provides a framework for screening antibody mutations for self-association, which could inform our feature engineering efforts.
