# MSED Framework Implementation - Isotype-Specific Safe Manifolds

## Objective
Implement isotype-specific safe manifolds for IgG antibodies using biophysical property calculations instead of generative models.

## Methodology
1. **Data Processing**: Load IgG thermostability dataset with Tm1 measurements
2. **CDR Extraction**: Extract CDR regions using Kabat numbering
3. **Biophysical Property Calculation**:
   - Charge: Sum of amino acid charges in CDR
   - Hydrophobicity: Average Kyte-Doolittle score in CDR
   - Aggregation Propensity: TANGO algorithm score for CDR regions
4. **Safe Manifold Definition**: Antibodies within biophysical constraints are considered in safe sequence space

## Biophysical Constraints
- Charge: -2 to +2 (weight: 0.3)
- Hydrophobicity: 0 to 5 (weight: 0.3)
- Aggregation Propensity: < 3.0 (weight: 0.4)

## Success Metrics
- Define safe manifold containing >50% of high-Tm antibodies
- Complete analysis within 24 hours
- Memory usage below 3.5GB
- No use of generative models or diffusion processes
