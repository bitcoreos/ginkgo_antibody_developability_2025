# Data Integrity Report

## Data Integrity Issues Identified

### Heldout Set File Corruption
- Problem: Extra duplicated column in heldout set file
- Root Cause: Unknown processing step added antibody_name column
- Impact: All model work between Oct 11-16 used incorrect data
- Evidence: File hash mismatch (0e80b563... vs. correct: cab33837...)

### Missing File Tracking
- Problem: No systematic tracking of file modifications
- Root Cause: Lack of automated validation and breadcrumb trail
- Impact: Difficult to identify when/ how files were modified

## Corrective Actions Taken

### File Restoration
- Date: October 18, 2025
- Action: Restored original heldout-set-sequences.csv from backup
- Verification: File hash now matches original competition file
- Location: /a0/bitcore/workspace/data/sequences/heldout-set-sequences.csv

### Validation Protocol
- Action: Created automated validation script
- Location: /a0/bitcore/workspace/scripts/validation/validate_workspace.sh
- Coverage: Validates key sequence files and MANIFEST.yaml

## Current File Status

GDPa1_v1.2_sequences.csv: VALID
heldout-set-sequences.csv: VALID
MANIFEST.yaml: VALID

## Work That Needs Redone

1. Feature engineering for heldout set
2. Model training and predictions
3. Submission file generation
4. Analysis based on previous model outputs

## Recommendations

1. Implement mandatory validation before processing
2. Establish breadcrumb trail for file modifications
3. Create automated alerts for data integrity violations
4. Regular validation checkpoints in processing pipeline
