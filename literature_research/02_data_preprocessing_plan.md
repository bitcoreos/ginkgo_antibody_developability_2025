# Data Preprocessing Plan for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the preprocessing steps required for the 390-feature antibody developability dataset before applying nested cross-validation.

## Data Characteristics
- Dataset size: n=246 samples
- Feature count: 390 features
- Target variables: AC-SINS_pH7.4 and Tm2
- Grouping variable: Sequence identity for GroupKFold splits

## Preprocessing Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
- Load dataset and verify structure
- Check for missing values
- Identify data types (numeric vs categorical)
- Examine target variable distributions

### 2. Low-Quality Feature Pruning
- Remove features with excessive missing values (>50%)
- Remove features with zero or near-zero variance
- Remove duplicate features

### 3. Handling Missing Values
- Identify remaining missing values after pruning
- Apply appropriate imputation strategy:
  - Mean imputation for normally distributed features
  - Median imputation for skewed features
  - Mode imputation for categorical features

### 4. Data Type Conversion
- Ensure all features are in appropriate numeric format
- Convert any string representations of numbers
- Handle any categorical variables if present

### 5. Scaling
- Apply StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions
- Fit scaler only on training data in each CV fold

### 6. Variance Thresholding
- Remove features with very low variance that may not contribute to prediction
- Threshold to be determined based on data distribution

### 7. Correlation Culling
- Identify highly correlated feature pairs (|r| > 0.95)
- Remove one feature from each highly correlated pair
- Preserve features that are most interpretable or theoretically important

## Implementation Considerations

### Leakage Prevention
- All preprocessing steps must be applied within CV folds
- No information from validation/test sets should influence training set preprocessing
- Scaler fitting and feature selection must occur only on training data

### Computational Efficiency
- With limited computational resources, preprocessing steps should be efficient
- Vectorized operations should be preferred over iterative approaches
- Memory usage should be monitored for the small dataset

## Validation Approach
- Verify preprocessing steps with simplified test data
- Check that no data leakage occurs between folds
- Confirm that preprocessing maintains data integrity

## Next Steps
1. Implement data loading and initial inspection
2. Implement low-quality feature pruning
3. Implement missing value handling
4. Implement scaling within CV framework
5. Implement variance thresholding and correlation culling
