# Nested Cross-Validation Framework Design

## Overview
This document outlines the framework for implementing nested cross-validation to evaluate the performance of antibody developability prediction models while preventing data leakage.

## Nested CV Structure

### Outer Loop - Performance Evaluation
- Purpose: Unbiased performance estimation
- Splitting: GroupKFold by sequence identity
- Number of folds: To be determined based on group distribution
- Output: Performance metrics across folds

### Inner Loop - Hyperparameter Tuning
- Purpose: Model selection and hyperparameter optimization
- Splitting: GroupKFold by sequence identity (same groups as outer loop)
- Number of folds: To be determined based on group distribution
- Output: Best model configuration for each outer fold

## Implementation Details

### GroupKFold Considerations
- Groups defined by sequence identity clustering
- Same group identifiers used in both inner and outer loops
- Ensures no data leakage between related samples
- May result in imbalanced fold sizes

### Performance Metrics
- Primary: Spearman correlation coefficient
- Secondary: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Per-fold metrics for variance analysis
- Confidence intervals where appropriate

### Model Selection Process
- Inner loop performs grid search for each model type
- Best parameters selected based on inner loop performance
- Outer loop evaluates performance of best configuration
- Model type selection based on outer loop performance

## Computational Strategy

### Resource Constraints
- Limited computational resources require efficient implementation
- Simplified parameter grids for initial testing
- Early stopping criteria for iterative algorithms
- Memory management between folds

### Parallelization
- Outer folds processed sequentially due to memory constraints
- Inner loop parameter combinations potentially parallelized
- Checkpointing to save intermediate results
- Progress tracking and logging

## Validation Framework

### Leakage Detection
- Monitor for performance inconsistencies that may indicate leakage
- Verify group splits are maintained correctly
- Check that preprocessing is applied within folds
- Validate feature selection occurs only on training data

### Stability Assessment
- Variance of performance metrics across folds
- Consistency of selected features across folds
- Stability of hyperparameter selections
- Permutation tests to establish significance

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Execution Failures
- Checkpointing to resume from last completed fold
- Detailed logging for debugging failed folds
- Isolation of fold-specific errors
- Graceful degradation when possible

### Data Issues
- Handling of missing values in target variables
- Management of outliers in predictions
- Validation of group identifiers
- Recovery from corrupted intermediate results

## Testing Approach

### Simplified Testing
- Initial implementation with reduced parameter grid
- Small subset of features for faster execution
- Limited number of models for initial validation
- Verification of framework correctness

### Full Implementation
- Complete parameter grids for all models
- All 390 features included in analysis
- Comprehensive performance evaluation
- Detailed diagnostics and analysis

## Output Structure

### Results Tracking
- Per-fold performance metrics
- Selected hyperparameters for each fold
- Feature importance measures
- Execution time tracking

### Artifact Generation
- Model objects (where feasible given memory constraints)
- Prediction values for each sample
- Diagnostic plots and visualizations
- Summary reports

## Next Steps
1. Implement simplified nested CV framework
2. Test with small subset of data and features
3. Document implementation details and any issues
4. Scale to full framework implementation
5. Validate performance estimation accuracy
