# Relevance Summary

The two cited studies provide complementary approaches to predicting antibody aggregation propensity. Lai & Gallegos (2022) demonstrate that structural features from molecular dynamics simulations, particularly spatial positive charge maps and hydrophobic surface areas, can effectively predict aggregation rates using k-nearest neighbors regression. This approach provides a biophysically grounded method for early-stage developability assessment. Kos et al. (2025) introduce a novel methodology combining AlphaFold-based structure prediction, molecular dynamics, and machine learning, with a key innovation being the use of molecular surface curvature combined with hydrophobicity and electrostatic potential. Their best model achieves a high prediction accuracy (r = 0.91), suggesting that surface geometry features significantly enhance aggregation prediction. Together, these studies establish a foundation for machine learning approaches to aggregation prediction that leverage both traditional biophysical properties and novel structural descriptors.
