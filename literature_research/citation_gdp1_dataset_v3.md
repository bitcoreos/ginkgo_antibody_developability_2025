## Relevance Summary
These citations provide foundational knowledge about the GDPa1 dataset, which is the primary dataset used in the 2025 AbDev Competition. They cover the dataset itself, the high-throughput platform used to generate the data, guided generation methods for developable antibodies, training approaches for developability models, and the PROPHET-Ab platform that enabled the dataset creation. They are directly relevant to developing predictive models for the 2025 AbDev Competition as they provide the foundational data and methods used in the competition.
