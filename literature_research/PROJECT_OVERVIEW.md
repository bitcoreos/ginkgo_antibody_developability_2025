# BITCORE Project Overview

## Project Summary

BITCORE (Bioinformatics Intelligence for Therapeutic COding and REsearch) is an advanced antibody developability prediction system built on the FLAb (Feature Learning for Antibodies) framework. The system integrates statistical, information-theoretic, and machine learning methods to predict critical antibody properties early in the R&D process.

## Core Architecture

The BITCORE system architecture combines multiple advanced methodologies:

1. **Statistical Methods**: Markov models and surprisal calculations for sequence analysis
2. **Information-Theoretic Approaches**: Multi-channel information theory framework integrating sequence, structure, and temporal data
3. **Machine Learning**: Ensemble learning, Neural-ODEs, and Graph Neural Networks for complex pattern recognition
4. **Polyreactivity Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of antibody binding specificity
5. **ESM-2 Protein Language Models**: State-of-the-art protein sequence understanding
6. **Multimodal Learning**: Integration of diverse data sources with uncertainty quantification

## Key Components

### Feature Engineering
- Evidence-based CDR feature extraction
- Aggregation propensity analysis (target correlation r=0.91)
- Thermal stability prediction (Spearman correlation 0.4-0.52)
- Structural property analysis

### Modeling Framework
- Random Forest implementation with hyperparameter optimization
- XGBoost gradient boosting models
- Cross-validation framework with proper handling of missing data
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

### Validation Infrastructure
- Systematic validation protocols
- Concept drift detection
- Automated quality assurance
- Data integrity verification

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in Python with the following key directories:

- `/a0/bitcore/workspace/data/`: Structured data storage (raw, processed, features, submissions, models)
- `/a0/bitcore/workspace/scripts/`: Core modeling and validation scripts
- `/a0/bitcore/workspace/flab_framework/`: Core prediction logic
- `/a0/bitcore/workspace/ml_algorithms/`: Advanced ML methods
- `/a0/bitcore/workspace/research/`: Domain-specific investigations

## Workflow

1. Feature generation from antibody sequences
2. Feature integration and preprocessing
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Prediction generation for heldout sets
5. Submission file creation
6. Validation and quality assurance

This consolidated overview provides a high-fidelity representation of the BITCORE project's current implementation and architecture.
