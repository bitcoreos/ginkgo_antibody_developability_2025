# Project Context
The BITCORE Antibody Research System is now incorporating the official announcement of the Antibody Developability Consortium launched by Ginkgo Bioworks and Apheris on September 4, 2025. This research direction focuses on the pre-competitive collaboration to address one of the most significant challenges in biologics development: predicting and optimizing antibody properties early in R&D. The system will prepare for enrollment in the consortium with initial datasets and models for multiple antibody formats expected in 2026, while also participating in the parallel AbDev AI Competition to establish field standards. The research leverages Ginkgo's PROPHET-Ab high-throughput platform for biophysical assessment to enable AI/ML model training.
