# Relevance Summary
1. Szkodny et al. (2024) directly measured expression (CHO Titer) of 178 single-point mutation variations of the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, providing a valuable dataset for understanding how sequence variations affect titer, which is directly relevant to our competition.

2. Zhang et al. (2025) demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can be used to optimize CHO cell cultivation processes, resulting in up to a 48% increase in final mAb titer, showing the potential of ML approaches for titer prediction and optimization.

3. Wang et al. (2025) apply machine learning approaches to identify genes correlated to high product titer and quality through large-scale transcriptomics analysis, providing insights into the molecular factors that influence titer.

4. Kumar et al. (2025) use machine learning to optimize culture conditions and feeding strategies for enhanced monoclonal antibody production in CHO cells, directly addressing factors that affect titer.

5. Li et al. (2025) use multi-omics profiling to understand how culture pH affects cell growth, antibody titer, and product quality in CHO cell systems, providing additional factors that could be relevant for titer prediction.
