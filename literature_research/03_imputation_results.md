# Results with Imputation Pipeline

## Overview
This document presents the results of the nested cross-validation implementation with corrected pipeline including imputation.

## Implementation Details
- Pre-selected top 100 features by correlation
- Pipeline includes: Imputation → Scaling → Feature Selection → Ridge Regression
- Parameter grid: alpha=[0.1, 1.0, 10.0], k=[30, 50, 100]
- First 2 folds of 5-fold CV (using pre-assigned folds)

## Results

### Performance Metrics
- Average RMSE: 0.0117 (+/- 0.0026)
- Average MAE: 0.0089 (+/- 0.0016)
- Average Spearman correlation: 0.9964 (+/- 0.0012)

### Best Parameters
- Fold 1: k=100, alpha=0.1
- Fold 2: k=100, alpha=0.1

## Analysis

### Overfitting Indicators
1. Extremely high Spearman correlation (0.9964)
2. Very low RMSE and MAE values
3. Consistent selection of maximum features (k=100)
4. Low regularization (alpha=0.1)

### Potential Causes
1. Still using relatively high number of features (100)
2. Insufficient regularization
3. Data leakage despite using pre-assigned folds

## Recommendations

### 1. More Aggressive Feature Selection
- Reduce feature set to 30-50 features
- Use stronger correlation threshold for pre-selection

### 2. Stronger Regularization
- Expand alpha range to include higher values
- Consider ElasticNet for combined L1/L2 regularization

### 3. Run Full 5-Fold CV
- Execute on all 5 folds to get complete results
- Monitor resource usage during execution

## Next Steps
1. Document current results
2. Implement more aggressive feature selection
3. Expand parameter grid for stronger regularization
4. Run full 5-fold CV with improvements
