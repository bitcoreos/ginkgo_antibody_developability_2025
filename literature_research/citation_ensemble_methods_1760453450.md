Relevance Summary
These citations collectively provide a foundation for developing an ensemble-based approach to antibody developability prediction. The AbLEF framework offers a novel method for fusing multiple language models with structural ensembles, while PROPERMAB presents an integrative in silico framework. The Frontiers study provides essential validation of hydrophobicity scales for HIC prediction. Together, they support our strategy of using ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy for the competition's assays.
