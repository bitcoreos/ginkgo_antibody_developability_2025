# Relevance Summary

Zhou et al. (2022) presents SSH2.0, an improved tool for predicting hydrophobic interaction risk of monoclonal antibodies directly from sequence. This machine learning approach addresses a critical developability challenge by enabling early identification of antibodies with high HIC retention risk, which correlates with aggregation propensity and poor solubility. The model's ability to predict hydrophobic interactions from sequence alone makes it particularly valuable for high-throughput screening of therapeutic candidates.

Li et al. (2025) introduces PROPERMAB, an integrative framework for *in silico* prediction of antibody developability properties using machine learning. The framework specifically includes models for predicting hydrophobic interaction chromatography retention time, enabling comprehensive developability assessment from sequence data. By combining sequence-based and structure-based features, PROPERMAB provides a scalable solution for predicting HIC retention and other critical biophysical properties, significantly accelerating the antibody development pipeline.
