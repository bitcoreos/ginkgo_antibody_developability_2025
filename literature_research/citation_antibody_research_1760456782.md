Project Context
The 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction Competition requires a paradigm shift from static prediction to dynamic developability assessment. Current hybrid models fail to capture the temporal evolution of developability risks, representing a critical gap in the field. The ultimate competitive advantage lies in creating a multi-dimensional framework that integrates sequence, structure, and temporal dynamics through information theory.

Relevance Summary

The AbODE paper introduces a novel generative model that extends graph PDEs to accommodate both contextual information and external interactions using conjoined neural ODEs. This directly addresses our research gap in temporal dynamics modeling for antibody developability, providing a mathematical framework for capturing the evolution of antibody-antigen interactions over time. The model's use of continuous differential attention that evolves with latent interactions offers a powerful approach for modeling the temporal aspects of developability risks.

The Biophysical Cartography paper provides a comprehensive analysis of developability parameter plasticity across over two million native and human-engineered antibody sequences. This large-scale study quantifies the redundancy, predictability, and sensitivity of developability parameters, establishing a fundamental resource for multi-parameter therapeutic mAb design. The finding that human-engineered antibodies localize within the developability landscapes of natural antibodies suggests constrained design spaces that can inform our temporal modeling approach, particularly in understanding how developability risks emerge and evolve during engineering processes.
