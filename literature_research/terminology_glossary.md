# BITCORE Terminology Glossary

This document provides standardized definitions for key terms used in the BITCORE framework to ensure clear communication and understanding.

## Model Terminology

### Machine Learning Algorithms
**Definition**: Classical statistical and machine learning methods used for prediction and classification.
**Examples**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks (traditional)
**Usage Context**: Refers to specific algorithms used in the predictive modeling pipeline for antibody developability.

### AI Models
**Definition**: Large language models and other artificial intelligence systems that process and generate information.
**Examples**: qwen3, llamas, BioLangFusion, PoET-2
**Usage Context**: Refers to pre-trained AI systems used for reasoning, feature extraction, or other AI-based tasks.

### AI Fine-Tuned Models
**Definition**: AI models that have been specifically adapted or fine-tuned for particular tasks within the BITCORE framework.
**Examples**: Fine-tuned versions of qwen3 or llamas for antibody sequence analysis
**Usage Context**: Refers to specialized versions of AI models that have been adapted for specific BITCORE tasks.

### Predictive Models
**Definition**: The complete modeling systems that combine various algorithms and AI components to predict antibody developability metrics.
**Examples**: The overall system that predicts HIC, PR_CHO, AC-SINS_pH7.4, Tm2, and Titer
**Usage Context**: Refers to the end-to-end modeling systems that produce the final predictions for the competition.

## Other Key Terms

### Research Engine
**Definition**: The deprecated component responsible for generating research outputs using AI models.
**Usage Context**: Refers to the legacy system that has been moved to the deprecated directory.

### Research Swarm
**Definition**: The deprecated distributed research system.
**Usage Context**: Refers to the legacy distributed research system that has been moved to the deprecated directory.
