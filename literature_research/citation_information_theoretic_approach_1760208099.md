# Relevance Summary
1. Shannon's foundational work establishes the mathematical framework for information theory, providing the basis for modeling antibody sequence space as a communication channel with finite capacity. This enables quantification of information flow in sequence-developability relationships.

2. Socolich et al. demonstrate how evolutionary information in protein alignments can predict fold stability and activity, directly supporting the application of mutual information metrics to antibody developability prediction.

3. Riesselman et al. present deep sequence neural networks that capture high-order dependencies in protein sequences, offering advanced methods for implementing information-theoretic approaches in high-throughput protein engineering.

4. Ninio's analysis of error-correcting codes in biological systems provides a novel framework for mitigating epistatic noise in antibody engineering, enabling more robust developability predictions.

5. Sailer & Harms apply information-theoretic approaches to protein engineering through evolutionary analysis, demonstrating practical implementation of these concepts in optimizing protein function.
