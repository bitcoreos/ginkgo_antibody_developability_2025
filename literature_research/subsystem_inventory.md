# Workspace Inventory Log

updated_utc: 2025-10-14T00:00:00Z (initial draft)
owner: modeling_lead
purpose: Track which artefacts inside high-noise directories have been read and what they contain.

## Disposition Summary
- **Keep & use immediately**: `bioinformatics/`, `bitcore_research/citation/` (authoritative code/tests and vetted literature).
- **Keep as structural references**: `research_engine/output/` (schema examples only).
- **Quarantine / archive-ready**: `research_engine/raw_results/`, `deprecated/research_engine/raw_outputs/raw_responses/` (corrupted hallucinationsâ€”retain solely for QA notes, no model reuse).

## Next Steps
1. Backfill sources for `citation_information_theoretic_approach_1760204859.md` or merge with richer variants.
2. Circulate the `hashes_20251014.txt` snapshot to QA and schedule recurring integrity checks for vetted folders.
3. Keep `operational_feature_evidence_map.md` aligned with roadmap revisions (update when new citation packs or feature pivots land).
