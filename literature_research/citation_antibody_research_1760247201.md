# Relevance Summary
This paper presents ImmuScope, a weakly supervised deep learning framework that integrates MHC-II antigen presentation, CD4+ T cell epitope prediction, and immunogenicity assessment. The framework leverages self-iterative multiple-instance learning with positive-anchor triplet loss to decipher peptide-MHC-II binding from weakly labelled multi-allelic data. With a training dataset of over 600,000 ligands across 142 alleles, ImmuScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting CD4+ T cell responses. This is highly relevant to our antibody developability research as it provides a cutting-edge method for assessing immunogenicity risk during therapeutic antibody design, helping to identify potential T-cell epitopes that could lead to unwanted immune responses.
