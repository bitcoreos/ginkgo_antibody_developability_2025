# Overfitting Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the overfitting observed in the adjusted nested cross-validation implementation.

## Current Results
- Average RMSE: 0.0010 (+/- 0.0001)
- Average MAE: 0.0008 (+/- 0.0001)
- Average Spearman correlation: 0.9979 (+/- 0.0015)

## Analysis

### Dataset Characteristics
- Total samples: 246
- Samples after removing missing targets: 242
- Initial features: 379 numerical features
- Features after variance thresholding: ~211
- Feature-to-sample ratio: ~0.87

### Overfitting Indicators
1. Extremely high Spearman correlation (0.9979)
2. Very low RMSE and MAE values
3. Consistent performance across all folds
4. High feature-to-sample ratio

### Potential Causes

#### 1. High Feature-to-Sample Ratio
- With ~211 features and 242 samples, the model may be overfitting
- The rule of thumb suggests 30-150 effective features for this dataset size
- Current implementation may have too many features

#### 2. Insufficient Regularization
- Ridge regression with alpha=0.1 may not be providing enough regularization
- Need to explore stronger regularization parameters

#### 3. Data Leakage
- Despite using pre-assigned folds, some leakage may still occur
- Features may contain information that directly correlates with targets

#### 4. Target Predictability
- The target variable may be relatively easy to predict given the features
- Some features may directly encode or closely correlate with the target

## Recommendations

### 1. Aggressive Feature Selection
- Reduce feature set to 30-150 features using more sophisticated methods
- Consider mutual information-based feature selection
- Use PCA to reduce dimensionality

### 2. Stronger Regularization
- Explore wider range of alpha values for Ridge regression
- Consider ElasticNet for combined L1/L2 regularization
- Implement feature selection within the pipeline

### 3. Improved Validation
- Implement permutation tests to verify model performance
- Use learning curves to diagnose overfitting
- Compare performance to baseline models

### 4. Alternative Approaches
- Consider using only top features by variance or correlation with target
- Explore ensemble methods to improve robustness
- Implement cross-assay learning to leverage multiple targets

## Next Steps
1. Implement aggressive feature selection
2. Expand parameter grids for regularization
3. Add diagnostic checks for overfitting
4. Document improved approach
5. Re-run nested CV with improvements
