Project Context
The strategic advantage in antibody developability prediction lies in creating uncertainty-aware hybrid architectures that combine sequence-based embeddings with structure-based 3D-CNN processing. Current hybrid models lack robust uncertainty quantification, which limits their reliability. This research focuses on integrating ImmuneBuilder's ABodyBuilder2 model, which provides ensemble-based error estimation, to create confidence-weighted features in hybrid architectures.

Relevance Summary

The first citation establishes ImmuneBuilder (ABodyBuilder2) as the state-of-the-art method for antibody structure prediction with built-in uncertainty quantification through ensemble prediction variability. This provides the foundation for creating confidence-weighted structural features in hybrid architectures, allowing high-uncertainty regions to be down-weighted during model training and inference.

The second citation demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods and Gaussian Process for uncertainty quantification in antibody prediction, showing how uncertainty-aware models can reduce experimental failure rates and accelerate lead optimization. This supports the strategic advantage of incorporating uncertainty quantification into hybrid architectures for more reliable developability predictions.
