## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in implementing the research framework components into the FLAb framework. The statistical and information-theoretic features, advanced polyreactivity features, protein language models, and ensemble methods with calibration techniques have been successfully implemented and integrated with the existing FLAb workflow.

The remaining work has been prioritized based on impact and feasibility. The next steps should focus on implementing validation infrastructure and the remaining polyreactivity features, which will provide significant enhancements to the framework's predictive capabilities.

All implementation work has been thoroughly tested and documented, ensuring that the FLAb framework continues to evolve toward a state-of-the-art platform for antibody developability prediction and optimization.
