# Relevance Summary
1. Wang et al. (2025) present PROPERMAB, an integrative framework that emphasizes the preference for integrating features at both sequence and structure levels, ease of engineering new features, and the need for robust model validation, especially in the data-limited, supervised learning regime such as antibody developability prediction.

2. Li et al. (2025) describe a Hybrid Structural-Sequential Architecture with Cross-Attention for Antibody Developability Prediction, which fuses 3D structural embeddings with sequential representations through cross-attention mechanisms, leveraging the strengths of both modalities.

3. Zhang et al. (2025) discuss sequence and structure-based models for predicting developability properties of antibodies, highlighting the importance of leveraging both sequence and structural information for accurate predictions.

4. Kumar et al. (2025) report on the application of a multimodal feature learning workflow for predicting the viscosity of antibodies in therapeutics discovery, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal approaches.

5. Chen et al. (2025) present empirical evaluations of sequence and structure-based in silico approaches for predicting developability properties, identifying the most effective approaches for different assays.

6. Olsen et al. (2025) introduce a guided discrete diffusion model for optimizing antibody sequences for favorable developability, using physical descriptors derived from predicted structures from protein language models to guide antibody design.
