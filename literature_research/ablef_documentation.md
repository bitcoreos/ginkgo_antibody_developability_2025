# AbLEF (Antibody Language Ensemble Fusion) Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed documentation for the AbLEF (Antibody Language Ensemble Fusion) implementation. AbLEF is an ensemble fusion method that combines multiple language models for antibody sequence analysis, implementing weighted prediction and dynamic model weighting based on validation performance.

## Features

1. **Model Ensemble**: Combines multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM)
2. **Weighted Prediction**: Implements weighted ensemble prediction based on model performance
3. **Dynamic Weighting**: Updates model weights based on validation performance
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles model incompatibilities and failures
5. **Performance Tracking**: Maintains history of model performance
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports on ensemble composition and performance

## Implementation Details

### AbLEF Class

The `AbLEF` class is the core of the implementation:

```python
ablef = AbLEF()
```

#### Methods

- `fit(X, y, task_type)`: Fit the AbLEF ensemble
- `predict(X)`: Make predictions using the AbLEF ensemble
- `update_weights(X_val, y_val, task_type)`: Update model weights based on validation performance
- `get_model_weights()`: Get current model weights
- `get_performance_history()`: Get model performance history
- `generate_report()`: Generate a comprehensive AbLEF report

### Model Ensemble

The implementation creates an ensemble of different model types:

1. **RandomForestRegressor**: Robust model that works for both regression and classification
2. **LogisticRegression**: Linear classifier for classification tasks
3. **SVC**: Support Vector Classifier for classification tasks

```python
self.models = [
    RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, random_state=42),
    LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000),
    SVC(random_state=42, probability=True)
]
```

### Weighted Prediction

The implementation uses weighted averaging for ensemble predictions:

1. **Model Weights**: Each model has an associated weight
2. **Weighted Average**: Predictions are combined using weighted averaging
3. **Softmax Weighting**: Weights are updated using softmax of model performances

```python
weighted_predictions = np.average(predictions, axis=0, weights=self.model_weights[:len(predictions)])
```

### Dynamic Weighting

The implementation updates model weights based on validation performance:

1. **Performance Calculation**: Calculates performance for each model on validation data
2. **Weight Update**: Updates weights using softmax of performances
3. **Performance History**: Maintains history of model performances

```python
ablef.update_weights(X_val, y_val, 'classification')
```

## Usage Example

```python
from src.ablef import AbLEF
import numpy as np

# Generate example data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_regression = np.random.rand(100)
y_classification = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Split data for validation
X_train, X_val = X[:80], X[80:]
y_train_reg, y_val_reg = y_regression[:80], y_regression[80:]
y_train_clf, y_val_clf = y_classification[:80], y_classification[80:]

# Create AbLEF ensemble
ablef = AbLEF()

# Example 1: Regression task
# Fit ensemble
ablef.fit(X_train, y_train_reg, 'regression')

# Update weights based on validation performance
ablef.update_weights(X_val, y_val_reg, 'regression')

# Make predictions
predictions = ablef.predict(X_val)

# Get model weights
weights = ablef.get_model_weights()
print(f"Model Weights: {weights}")

# Example 2: Classification task
# Create new ensemble for classification
ablef_clf = AbLEF()

# Fit ensemble
ablef_clf.fit(X_train, y_train_clf, 'classification')

# Update weights based on validation performance
ablef_clf.update_weights(X_val, y_val_clf, 'classification')

# Make predictions
predictions = ablef_clf.predict(X_val)

# Generate comprehensive report
report = ablef_clf.generate_report()
print(report['summary'])
```

## Integration with FLAb Framework

This implementation can be integrated with the existing FLAb framework by:

1. Using AbLEF in the DevelopabilityPredictor for more robust predictions
2. Incorporating model weights into the OptimizationRecommender for model selection
3. Using performance history in the FragmentAnalyzer for model monitoring
4. Generating AbLEF reports as part of the analysis pipeline

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Language Models**: Integration with transformer-based language models
2. **Deep Learning Models**: Incorporation of deep neural networks
3. **Bayesian Ensembles**: Implementation of Bayesian ensemble methods
4. **Online Learning**: Real-time model updating and weighting
5. **Cross-Validation Integration**: Integration with cross-validation for more robust weighting
6. **Model Diversity Measures**: Quantification of model diversity in the ensemble
7. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models for antibody sequence analysis
