# Nested CV Implementation Results

## Overview
This document describes the results from the simplified nested cross-validation implementation.

## Implementation Details
- Dataset: modeling_feature_matrix_with_enhanced_cdr.csv
- Samples: 242 (after removing 4 samples with missing target values)
- Initial features: 378 numerical features
- Excluded columns: antibody_id, CDR sequences, predicted_isotype, fold, Tm2_DSF_degC
- Target variable: AC-SINS_pH7.4_nmol/mg
- Grouping variable: antibody_id

## Nested CV Framework
- Outer CV: 3-fold GroupKFold for performance evaluation
- Inner CV: 3-fold GroupKFold for hyperparameter tuning
- Model: Ridge regression
- Parameter grid: alpha = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0]
- Preprocessing: Variance thresholding + Standard scaling

## Results

### Per-Fold Performance

#### Fold 1
- Best alpha: 0.1
- RMSE: 0.0014
- MAE: 0.0011
- Spearman correlation: 0.9987

#### Fold 2
- Best alpha: 0.1
- RMSE: 0.0024
- MAE: 0.0019
- Spearman correlation: 0.9987

#### Fold 3
- Best alpha: 0.1
- RMSE: 0.0035
- MAE: 0.0027
- Spearman correlation: 0.9974

### Overall Performance
- Average RMSE: 0.0024 (+/- 0.0008)
- Average MAE: 0.0019 (+/- 0.0006)
- Average Spearman correlation: 0.9983 (+/- 0.0006)

## Analysis

### Framework Validation
- Nested CV framework executed successfully
- Inner and outer loops properly implemented with GroupKFold
- Hyperparameter tuning worked as expected
- Best parameters consistent across folds (alpha = 0.1)

### Performance Considerations
- Extremely high Spearman correlation suggests potential overfitting
- Very low RMSE and MAE values may indicate data leakage or overfitting
- Performance consistency across folds is good

### Potential Issues
- Data splits may not be sufficiently challenging
- Feature selection may be too aggressive or not properly implemented
- Need to verify that groups are properly maintained across splits

## Next Steps
1. Investigate potential overfitting issues
2. Implement more realistic data splits
3. Add additional model types for comparison
4. Implement full parameter grids
5. Add diagnostic checks for data leakage
