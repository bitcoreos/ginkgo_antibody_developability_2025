# Pipeline Construction for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the construction of the preprocessing and modeling pipeline for the nested cross-validation implementation.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
The preprocessing pipeline will include the following steps:

#### a. Feature Selection
- Remove duplicated columns
- Remove low variance columns
- Select only numerical features for modeling
- Exclude sequence data and other object columns

#### b. Missing Value Handling
- Identify columns with missing values
- Apply mean imputation within CV folds

#### c. Scaling
- Apply StandardScaler within CV framework
- Fit and transform only on training data

### 2. Feature Selection Pipeline
Options for feature selection:
- PCA transformation
- Mutual information-based feature selection

### 3. Model Pipeline
Models to implement:
- Ridge regression
- ElasticNet regression
- XGBoost regression
- RandomForest regression

## Implementation Approach

### sklearn Pipeline Integration
We will use sklearn's Pipeline class to combine preprocessing, feature selection, and model training:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, ElasticNet
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import xgboost as xgb

# Example pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('feature_selection', PCA()),  # or SelectKBest()
    ('model', Ridge())  # or other models
])
```

### Leakage Prevention Measures
All preprocessing steps will be applied within the CV framework to prevent data leakage:
- StandardScaler fitted only on training data
- Feature selection performed only on training data
- No information from validation/test sets influences training set preprocessing

## Pipeline Design Considerations

### Modularity
- Each component can be easily swapped or modified
- Different models can be plugged into the same pipeline structure
- Feature selection methods can be interchanged

### Flexibility
- Parameter grids can be defined for all pipeline components
- Different configurations can be tested within the nested CV framework

### Computational Efficiency
- Pipeline components are designed to be computationally efficient
- Memory usage is minimized by processing data in-place where possible
- Vectorized operations are preferred

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Preprocessing Function
- Function to identify and remove duplicated columns
- Function to identify and remove low variance columns
- Function to select numerical features

### Step 2: Implement Missing Value Handling
- Function to identify columns with missing values
- Function to apply mean imputation within CV folds

### Step 3: Construct sklearn Pipeline
- Combine preprocessing steps with feature selection and model
- Ensure all steps are compatible with CV framework

### Step 4: Validate Pipeline
- Test with simplified data
- Verify no data leakage
- Confirm proper parameter passing

## Error Handling
- Handle cases where columns have all missing values
- Manage cases where variance calculation fails
- Gracefully handle incompatible data types

## Testing Strategy
- Test each pipeline component independently
- Verify preprocessing steps maintain data integrity
- Confirm feature selection works as expected
- Validate model training and prediction

## Next Steps
1. Implement simplified preprocessing functions
2. Create basic sklearn pipeline structure
3. Test with small subset of data
4. Document implementation details
5. Scale to full pipeline implementation
