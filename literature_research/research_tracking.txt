# Project Tracking\n\n## Research Log\nLocation: /a0/bitcore/workspace/citation/research_log.md\n\n## Completion Flags\nThe research log contains completion flags to prevent reprocessing of the same research direction.\n\nExample:\n- Task: Antibody titer prediction\n- Status: Completed\n- Completion Flag: SET\n\n## Importance for Current Work\nWhile we need to redo model work due to data integrity issues, we should avoid repeating research directions that have already been completed.\n\nCheck the research log before starting new research directions to ensure we're not duplicating effort.
