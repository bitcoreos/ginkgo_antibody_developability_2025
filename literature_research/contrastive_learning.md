# Contrastive Learning for Antibody Developability Prediction

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Contrastive Learning for predicting antibody developability properties. The implementation is a simplified version designed to demonstrate the core concepts of contrastive learning in the context of antibody engineering.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The Contrastive Learning implementation consists of:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Two views of the same data (e.g., different augmentations of antibody sequences)

2. **Encoder Network**: A neural network that maps input features to embeddings

3. **Projection Head**: A small neural network that maps embeddings to a space where contrastive loss is applied

4. **Predictor Network**: A small neural network that predicts the target embeddings

5. **Contrastive Loss**: A loss function that encourages similar samples to have similar embeddings and dissimilar samples to have different embeddings

### Key Components

#### ContrastiveLearningModel Class

The main class implements a simplified contrastive learning model with the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the model with specified dimensions and temperature parameter
- `encode`: Encodes input features to embeddings using the encoder network
- `predict`: Predicts embeddings using the predictor network
- `compute_similarity`: Computes similarity between two sets of embeddings using cosine similarity
- `contrastive_loss`: Computes contrastive loss between two sets of embeddings
- `fit`: Trains the model on provided data
- `get_embeddings`: Gets embeddings for input data
- `evaluate`: Computes evaluation metrics
- `get_training_loss`: Returns training loss history
- `generate_report`: Generates a comprehensive report of the model

## Usage Example

The implementation includes a main function that demonstrates how to use the contrastive learning model with example data:

1. Generate two views of the same data (e.g., different augmentations of antibody sequences)
2. Initialize the contrastive learning model
3. Train the model on the two views
4. Get embeddings and evaluate performance

## Application to Antibody Developability

In the context of antibody developability prediction, contrastive learning can be applied as follows:

1. **Data Views**: Create two views of antibody data through:
   - Different data augmentation techniques
   - Different feature representations
   - Different time points in the development process

2. **Features**: Each view can include:
   - Amino acid sequences
   - Physicochemical properties
   - Structural features
   - Biophysical measurements

3. **Target Properties**: The learned embeddings can be used to predict various developability properties such as:
   - Solubility
   - Expression yield
   - Aggregation propensity
   - Immunogenicity
   - Thermal stability

## Limitations

This is a simplified implementation with several limitations:

1. **Simplified Training**: The training process uses simplified gradient updates rather than proper backpropagation
2. **Basic Architecture**: Uses a simple feedforward network without advanced architectures
3. **Limited Features**: Does not include advanced features like momentum encoders or memory banks
4. **Small Scale**: Designed for demonstration rather than large-scale production use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to this implementation could include:

1. **Advanced Architectures**: Implementing more sophisticated encoder networks
2. **Proper Backpropagation**: Implementing complete gradient computation for training
3. **Memory Banks**: Adding memory banks to improve negative sampling
4. **Integration with Existing Pipelines**: Connecting with the existing antibody developability prediction workflows

## Conclusion

This contrastive learning implementation provides a foundation for applying self-supervised learning to antibody developability prediction. While simplified, it demonstrates the core concepts and can be extended for more sophisticated applications.
