# Relevance Summary
1. This comprehensive benchmark evaluates state-of-the-art inverse folding models for antibody CDR sequence design. The findings provide critical guidance for selecting appropriate models in our therapeutic development pipeline, with particular emphasis on CDR-H3 loop design accuracy and developability prediction, which are essential for our competition goals.
3. FlowDesign introduces a novel flow matching approach for antibody CDR design that overcomes limitations of diffusion-based models. This is highly relevant for our research as it enables more accurate co-design of CDR sequences and structures, directly improving our ability to generate high-quality therapeutic antibodies with desired binding specificity and affinity.
