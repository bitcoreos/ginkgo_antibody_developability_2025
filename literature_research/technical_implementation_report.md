## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

The BITCORE project focuses on developing advanced computational methods for predicting antibody developability properties using the GDPa1 dataset. The project implements a comprehensive framework called FLAb (Fragment-based Antibody) that integrates statistical, information-theoretic, and machine learning approaches to predict five key developability properties: hydrophobicity (AC-SINS_pH7.4), polyreactivity (PR_CHO), self-association (self_association), thermostability (Tm2_DSF_degC), and titer (Titer_g/L).

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this implementation are:
1. To develop a robust framework for antibody sequence analysis
