## Advanced Learning Techniques Implementation (2025-10-18)

Completed implementation of nine advanced machine learning techniques for antibody developability prediction:

1. Graph Neural Networks - For modeling complex relationships in antibody structures and sequences
2. Contrastive Learning - For learning meaningful representations by contrasting positive and negative samples
3. Federated Learning - For training models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy
4. Transfer Learning - For leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance on target task
5. Active Learning - For strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling
6. Uncertainty Quantification - For estimating confidence in model predictions
7. Multi-Task Learning - For learning multiple related tasks simultaneously
8. Multimodal Biophysical Integration - For integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive modeling
9. Temporal Dynamics with Neural-ODEs - For modeling continuous temporal dynamics in developability

For each technique, created:
- Implementation in Python
- Documentation explaining the approach and application to antibody developability
- Test code demonstrating usage

Also created:
- Summary document describing how all techniques can be integrated
- README for the advanced_learning_techniques directory
- Requirements file for dependencies

These implementations provide a comprehensive toolkit for advanced antibody developability prediction that can be integrated into the existing workflow.
