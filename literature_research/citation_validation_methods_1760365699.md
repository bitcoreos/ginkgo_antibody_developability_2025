   - Impact Factor: 5.2
   - URL: https://doi.org/10.3389/fddsv.2025.1628789
   - Abstract: This paper describes an AI-driven approach to antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) design that integrates structural dynamics from cryo-EM with neural ordinary differential equations (Neural-ODEs) to predict payload release kinetics. The framework is validated experimentally using in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in vivo tumor models, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy for therapeutic efficacy.
