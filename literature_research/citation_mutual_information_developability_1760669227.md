# Mutual Information Applications in Antibody Developability Prediction

## Project Context
The BITCORE framework is participating in the Ginkgo Bio 2025 AbDev competition to predict antibody developability metrics. The framework implements several advanced feature engineering modules including mutual information calculations that are not currently integrated into the main feature pipeline. This research aims to validate and expand the use of mutual information for antibody property prediction.

## Keywords
mutual information, antibody developability, sequence analysis, machine learning, feature engineering, antibody aggregation, antibody stability

## Relevance Summary
These citations provide evidence for the application of mutual information and related information-theoretic approaches in antibody developability prediction. PROPERMAB specifically mentions mutual information as part of its framework for in silico developability assessment. The Lund University paper directly applies mutual information in a machine learning pipeline for developability prediction. The other papers provide context for high-throughput platforms, structure prediction, and best practices that support the use of advanced feature engineering techniques like mutual information in antibody research.
