## Relevance Summary
These citations provide foundational knowledge about polyreactivity measurement in antibodies using CHO cells, including the genetic basis of polyreactivity, in silico assessment methods, machine learning approaches for prediction, structural features related to polyreactivity, and protein language models for prediction. They are directly relevant to developing predictive models for the 2025 AbDev Competition, particularly given the inverse relationship between entropy and PR_CHO values identified in recent research.
