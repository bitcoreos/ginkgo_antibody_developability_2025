# Active Learning for Antibody Developability Prediction

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Active Learning for predicting antibody developability properties. The implementation is a simplified version designed to demonstrate the core concepts of active learning in the context of antibody engineering.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The Active Learning implementation consists of:

1. **Base Model**: A neural network that learns to predict developability properties

2. **Acquisition Function**: A strategy for selecting the most informative samples to label

3. **Labeling Oracle**: In practice, this would be experimental measurements, but in this implementation we simulate it with known labels

4. **Active Learning Loop**: An iterative process that selects samples, obtains labels, and retrains the model

### Key Components

#### ActiveLearningModel Class

The main class implements a simplified active learning model with the following methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the model with specified dimensions and acquisition strategy
- `forward_pass`: Performs forward propagation through the neural network
- `compute_loss`: Computes mean squared error loss
- `backward_pass`: Computes gradients for backpropagation
- `update_weights`: Updates model weights using gradients
- `predict`: Makes predictions using the trained model
- `uncertainty_sampling`: Selects samples with highest prediction uncertainty
- `random_sampling`: Randomly selects samples
- `margin_sampling`: Selects samples with smallest margin between top predictions
- `select_samples`: Selects samples for labeling based on acquisition strategy
- `active_learning_loop`: Performs the complete active learning loop
- `evaluate`: Computes evaluation metrics
- `get_training_loss`: Returns training loss history
- `generate_report`: Generates a comprehensive report of the model

## Usage Example

The implementation includes a main function that demonstrates how to use the active learning model with example data:

1. Generate example data with a small initially labeled set and a large unlabeled pool
2. Initialize the active learning model
3. Perform the active learning loop with multiple iterations
4. Make predictions and evaluate performance

## Application to Antibody Developability

In the context of antibody developability prediction, active learning can be applied as follows:

1. **Limited Labeling Budget**: Experimental measurements are expensive and time-consuming

2. **Strategic Sample Selection**: Selecting the most informative antibodies for experimental testing

3. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improving the model as new experimental data becomes available

4. **Features**: The model can use various features such as:
   - Amino acid sequences
   - Physicochemical properties
   - Structural features
   - Biophysical measurements

5. **Target Properties**: The model can predict various developability properties such as:
   - Solubility
   - Expression yield
   - Aggregation propensity
   - Immunogenicity
   - Thermal stability

## Acquisition Strategies

The implementation includes three acquisition strategies:

1. **Uncertainty Sampling**: Selects samples where the model is most uncertain about its predictions

2. **Random Sampling**: Selects samples randomly (baseline strategy)

3. **Margin Sampling**: Selects samples with the smallest margin between top predictions

## Limitations

This is a simplified implementation with several limitations:

1. **Simple Acquisition Functions**: Uses simplified proxies for uncertainty rather than sophisticated methods
2. **Basic Architecture**: Uses a simple feedforward network without advanced architectures
3. **Limited Features**: Does not include advanced features like ensemble methods or Bayesian neural networks
4. **Small Scale**: Designed for demonstration rather than large-scale production use

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to this implementation could include:

1. **Advanced Architectures**: Implementing more sophisticated neural network architectures
2. **Bayesian Neural Networks**: Using Bayesian methods for better uncertainty quantification
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Using multiple models for more robust uncertainty estimation
4. **Integration with Existing Pipelines**: Connecting with the existing antibody developability prediction workflows

## Conclusion

This active learning implementation provides a foundation for strategically selecting antibodies for experimental testing in developability prediction. While simplified, it demonstrates the core concepts and can be extended for more sophisticated applications.
