## Conclusion

All major components of the research framework have been successfully implemented and integrated into the FLAb framework. The statistical and information-theoretic features, advanced polyreactivity features, protein language models, ensemble methods with calibration techniques, validation infrastructure, and heavy-light coupling analysis with subclass-specific developability prediction have all been implemented and integrated with the existing FLAb workflow.

The remaining work focuses on documentation updates and potential performance optimizations. The FLAb framework is now ready for final testing and submission preparation for the 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction Competition.
