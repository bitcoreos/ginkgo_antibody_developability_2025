# Environment Setup for Nested CV Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the Python environment setup for the nested cross-validation implementation for antibody developability prediction.

## Python Environment
- Version: 3.13.7 (main, Aug 20 2025, 22:17:40) [GCC 14.3.0]
- Virtual environment: Active (venv)

## Required Libraries
All required libraries are already installed in the environment:

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| scikit-learn | 1.7.2 | Machine learning pipeline and cross-validation |
| xgboost | 3.0.5 | Gradient boosting implementation |
| numpy | 2.3.3 | Numerical computing |
| pandas | 2.3.3 | Data manipulation and analysis |
| scipy | 1.16.2 | Scientific computing |

## Additional Libraries
No additional libraries need to be installed for the core implementation.

## Environment Validation
The environment has been validated with the following command:
```bash
python -c "import sys; print(f'Python version: {sys.version}')" && pip list | grep -E 'scikit-learn|xgboost|numpy|pandas|scipy'
```

## Resource Considerations
- The environment is already optimized for machine learning tasks
- All required libraries are up-to-date
- No additional installation time required
- Memory footprint of existing libraries is acceptable for the dataset size

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with data loading and initial exploration
2. Implement preprocessing steps
3. Construct the pipeline
4. Test with simplified parameters
