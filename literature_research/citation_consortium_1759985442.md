# Project Context
The BITCORE Antibody Research System is now incorporating the newly announced Antibody Developability Consortium launched by Ginkgo Bioworks and Apheris on September 4, 2025. This research direction focuses on the pre-competitive collaboration to establish shared datasets and models for multiple antibody formats, with initial data expected in 2026. The system will leverage participation in the AbDev AI Competition with its $60K prize pool to validate prediction capabilities against standardized benchmarks, addressing the data scarcity problem in antibody developability prediction.
