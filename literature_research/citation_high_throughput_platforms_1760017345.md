# Project Context

The project involves antibody developability prediction using machine learning and AI. Key aspects include the BITCORE Antibody Research System, the PROPHET-Ab platform for structural inference of antibodyâ€“ligand complexes, the PROPERMAB framework for in silico prediction of antibody developability, and a system architecture utilizing n8n workflows, Morpheus AI, CORE API, and the BITCORE framework. The project aims to develop a superior antibody model within a month-long timeline, analyzing one antibody developability parameter at a time with a distributed AI swarm.

# Relevance Summary

These three citations provide critical methods for generating large-scale experimental data to train AI/ML models for antibody developability prediction. The PROPHET-Ab platform (Arsiwala et al., 2025) enables high-throughput biophysical assessment of hundreds of antibodies, directly addressing the data scarcity problem in developability prediction. The in silico SEC assay model (Abeer et al., 2025) demonstrates how machine learning can accelerate antibody optimization by predicting aggregation behavior. The molecular surface descriptor approach (Park & Izadi, 2024) provides a novel computational method to predict developability from structural features, complementing experimental data with predictive modeling. Together, these works form a comprehensive framework for integrating high-throughput experimentation with AI/ML to advance antibody therapeutics development.
