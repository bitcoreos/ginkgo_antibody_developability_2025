# Neural Cluster Test Results Tracking

## Test Execution Log

| Timestamp | Neuron | Payload | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') | All Neurons | {"systemprompt": "You are a biology websearcher. Explain the structure and function of antibodies as requested.", "researchterm": "What is the shape of an antibody molecule? Answer in one word."} | Dispatched | Asynchronous test initiated |

## Expected Response Timeline

- **Processing Time**: 10-20 minutes per neuron
- **Response Pattern**: Results will arrive asynchronously
- **Success Criteria**: Non-empty JSON response with antibody shape information

## Result Collection Protocol

1. Check test_results/ directory every 30 minutes
2. For each completed response:
   - Record timestamp
   - Extract key information
   - Note any errors or anomalies
3. Compile comparative analysis when all results are available

## Known Issues to Monitor

- Neuron_llama-3.3-70b: Frequent errors
- Gateway timeouts: May result in empty responses
- JSON path issues: May prevent proper data flow
- API failures: Expected in test environment

## Success Metrics

- At least 4 of 6 neurons return valid responses
- Responses contain accurate scientific information
- Average processing time under 20 minutes
- No critical system failures
