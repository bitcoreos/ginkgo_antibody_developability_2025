# BITCORE 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction - Validation Plan

## Objective
Comprehensive validation of all data processing steps, algorithms, and final submission files to ensure error-free, robust, and competition-ready deliverables.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Data Pipeline Traceability
- Trace all data transformations from raw input to final submission files
- Verify data integrity at each processing step
- Document all data sources and their transformations

### 2. Algorithm Output Verification
- Validate output of each algorithm component
- Check statistical and information-theoretic features
- Verify protein language model embeddings
- Confirm ensemble methods and calibration
- Validate advanced ML frameworks (AbLEF, PROPERMAB, Neural-ODEs, GNNs)

### 3. Cross-Validation and Integration Testing
- Verify cross-validation fold assignments
- Test integration of all components
- Confirm data flow between modules

### 4. Submission File Validation
- Verify schema compliance for both submission files
- Check all required fields are present and correctly formatted
- Validate data ranges and types
- Confirm proper sorting and encoding

### 5. Recursive Process Validation
- Validate process from multiple perspectives
- Check for consistency across different execution paths
- Ensure reproducibility of results

### 6. Error Handling and Robustness
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify graceful handling of missing or invalid data
- Confirm backup and recovery mechanisms

### 7. Documentation and Reporting
- Document all validation steps and results
- Generate validation report
- Update project documentation with findings

## Execution Timeline
- Start: Immediately
- Status updates: Every 2 hours
- Completion: Within 24 hours

## Success Criteria
- All validation steps completed
- Zero critical errors
- Submission files verified as competition-ready
- Comprehensive validation report generated
