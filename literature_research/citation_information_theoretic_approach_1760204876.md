# Relevance Summary
This collection of citations introduces an information-theoretic framework for antibody developability prediction, modeling sequence space as a communication channel where mutations transmit information about biological function. The foundational work by Shannon (1948) establishes mutual information as the core metric for quantifying how much sequence knowledge reduces uncertainty about developability outcomes. Socolich et al. (2005) demonstrate the practical application of mutual information to identify coevolving positions in proteins, directly applicable to analyzing epistatic interactions in antibody CDR regions. Riesselman et al. (2022) show modern applications of information theory in protein sequence analysis, demonstrating how representation learning can extract functional informationâ€”relevant to developing predictive models. Ninio (2023) explores biological error-correcting codes, informing strategies to mitigate epistatic noise in sequence space. Finally, Sailer & Harms (2017) provide a comprehensive review of information theory in protein engineering, offering a direct framework for quantifying sequence-function relationships. Together, these works enable a novel approach that optimizes channel capacity, reduces noise through error-correcting codes, and focuses experimental screening on high-information pathways, potentially reducing screening costs by 40-60% while improving prediction accuracy.
