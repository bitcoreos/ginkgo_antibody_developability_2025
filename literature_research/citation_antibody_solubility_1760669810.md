## Relevance Summary

The citation by Feng et al. (2022) presents solPredict, a method that employs embeddings from pretrained protein language modeling to predict the apparent solubility of monoclonal antibodies. This approach eliminates the need for 3D structure modeling and expert-crafted input features, making it particularly relevant for high-throughput screening in early antibody discovery.

The work by Hashemi et al. (2022) focuses on using machine learning (ANN and RSM) to optimize the production of recombinant antibody fragments in E. coli strains. While focused on production rather than sequence-based prediction, it demonstrates the application of machine learning to antibody solubility challenges.

The master's thesis by Björkhem and Höjding (2025) compares multiple machine learning strategies for predicting protein solubility, a key developability factor. Their work evaluated existing models like NetSolP, SWI, and ProteinSol, and developed new approaches including logistic regression and clustering-based methods.

The MIT News article by Attia and Burns (2025) describes a new computational model (FastSolv) that predicts how well molecules will dissolve in organic solvents. While not specific to antibodies, the underlying methodology and machine learning approach could be adapted for antibody solubility prediction.
