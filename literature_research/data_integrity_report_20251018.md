# Data Integrity Report - October 18, 2025

## Executive Summary
This report documents data integrity issues identified in the antibody developability prediction project and the corrective actions taken to restore data validity.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Heldout Set File Corruption
- **Problem**: The heldout set file in the active workspace contained an extra duplicated column
- **Root Cause**: During an unknown processing step, an additional "antibody_name" column was added to the file
- **Impact**: All model training and predictions performed between October 11-16 were based on corrupted data
- **Evidence**: File hash mismatch (current: 0e80b563950bb9ebc09a4876d8a58e15e553bd5a4a6f575d13767a910309dd80 vs. correct: cab3383787b88808be863dc2a329f73a643d47e39f01fa6e83d372071a780609)

### 2. Missing File Tracking
- **Problem**: No systematic tracking of file modifications or validation history
- **Root Cause**: Lack of automated validation and breadcrumb trail system
- **Impact**: Difficult to identify when and how files were modified

## Corrective Actions Taken

### 1. File Restoration
- **Date**: October 18, 2025
- **Action**: Restored original heldout-set-sequences.csv from backup
- **Verification**: File hash now matches original competition file
- **Location**: /a0/bitcore/workspace/data/sequences/heldout-set-sequences.csv

### 2. Validation Protocol Establishment
- **Action**: Created automated validation script
- **Location**: /a0/bitcore/workspace/scripts/validation/validate_workspace.sh
- **Coverage**: Currently validates key sequence files and MANIFEST.yaml

## Current File Status

| File | Status | Hash | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| GDPa1_v1.2_sequences.csv | VALID | 9f3c68431802185e072f86e06ba65475fb6e4b097b5ff689486dd8ad266164f1 | Original competition file |
| heldout-set-sequences.csv | VALID | cab3383787b88808be863dc2a329f73a643d47e39f01fa6e83d372071a780609 | Restored original competition file |
| MANIFEST.yaml | VALID | 0c910d73a563aab46aedd41d24b859908794d417834f48358fa929bb7788491a | Project manifest file |

## Work That Needs Redone

Due to the data integrity issues, all work performed between October 11-16 needs to be redone:

1. Feature engineering for heldout set
2. Model training and predictions
3. Submission file generation
4. Any analysis or reports based on previous model outputs

## Recommendations

1. Implement mandatory validation before all processing steps
2. Establish breadcrumb trail system for all file modifications
3. Create automated alerts for data integrity violations
4. Regular validation checkpoints in processing pipeline

## Validation Script

The validation script is located at `/a0/bitcore/workspace/scripts/validation/validate_workspace.sh` and should be run before any processing steps.
