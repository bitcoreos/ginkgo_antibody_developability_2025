## Phased Execution Strategy

### Setup (1 hour)
- Create directory structure
- Initialize README files
- Document current state

### Validation (2 hours)
- Verify endpoint connectivity (staggered)
- Test single workflow execution
- Validate data flow

### Research Execution (Ongoing)
- Execute research in batches of 2 neurons
- Wait 10 minutes between batches
- Monitor system performance

### Processing (1 day)
- Parse raw responses
- Generate summaries
- Create comprehensive report

## Documentation Standards

- File naming: Use lowercase with hyphens, no spaces
- Version control: Track all changes in git repository

### README Content
- Project purpose and scope
- Directory structure explanation
- Setup and installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Contact information
