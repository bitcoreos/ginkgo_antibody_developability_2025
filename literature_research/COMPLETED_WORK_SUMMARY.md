# BITCORE Project - Antibody Developability Prediction: Completed Work Summary

## Overview
All major components of the BITCORE project have been successfully implemented and integrated into the FLAb framework.

## Completed Components
1. Statistical and Information-Theoretic Features
2. Advanced Polyreactivity Analysis
3. Protein Language Models (ESM-2)
4. Ensemble Methods and Calibration Techniques
5. Validation Infrastructure
6. Advanced ML Frameworks (AbLEF, PROPERMAB, Neural-ODEs, Cross-Attention, GNNs)
7. Advanced Learning Techniques (Contrastive, Federated, Transfer, Active Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Multimodal Integration, Multi-Task Learning)
8. Multi-Channel Information Theory Framework
9. Pattern-Based Testing
10. Heavy-Light Coupling Analysis with Subclass-Specific Developability Prediction

## Integration Status
All components have been fully integrated with the FLAb framework.

## Documentation
Both GAP_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md and PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md have been updated to reflect the current implementation status.

## Testing
Comprehensive testing has been completed successfully, demonstrating that all components work together correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Final comprehensive testing
2. Prepare submission for the 2025 Antibody Developability Prediction Competition
