# BITCORE Master Plan

## Objective

Win the [Ginkgo Bio 2025 AbDev competition](https://datapoints.ginkgo.bio/ai-competitions/2025-abdev-competition) by creating a superior antibody model using the BITCORE framework's unique capabilities.

## Four-Layer Cognition Engine Implementation

### 1. PERCEPTION (Objective)

**Goal**: Predict antibody developability metrics accurately using both DNA and amino acid sequences.

**Competition Requirements**:
- Utilize the [GDPa1 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ginkgo-datapoints/GDPa1)
- Evaluate using official metrics: Spearman correlation, Top-10% recall
- Submission via Hugging Face [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ginkgo-datapoints/abdev-leaderboard)

### 2. CONCEPTION (Strategy)

**Framework**: BITCORE (Bioinformatics Intelligence for Therapeutic COding and REsearch)

**Core Approach**:
- Integrate statistical, information-theoretic, and machine learning methods
- Leverage FLAb (Feature Learning for Antibodies) framework
- Combine Markov models, surprisal calculations, polyreactivity analysis
- Utilize ESM-2 protein language models
- Implement ensemble learning, Neural-ODEs, and Graph Neural Networks
- Enable heavy-light chain coupling across isotypes
- Employ multimodal learning with uncertainty quantification

### 3. JUDGMENT (Validation)

**Quality Assurance**:
- Systematic validation protocols
- Concept drift detection
- Automated QA processes
- Pattern-based test arsenal

### 4. EXECUTION (Implementation)

**Workflow**:
1. Feature generation from antibody sequences
2. Feature integration and preprocessing
3. Model training with cross-validation
4. Prediction generation for heldout sets
5. Submission file creation
6. Validation and quality assurance

## Key Success Factors

1. **Technical Excellence**: Implementation of advanced ML methods and proper validation
2. **Data Integrity**: Accurate feature engineering and proper handling of missing data
3. **Model Performance**: High correlation with competition metrics
4. **Innovation**: Unique approaches that differentiate BITCORE from other competitors

## Timeline

- **Feature Engineering**: Complete by 2025-10-25
- **Model Training**: Complete by 2025-10-30
- **Validation**: Complete by 2025-11-05
- **Submission**: Complete by 2025-11-10

This master plan provides a clear roadmap for achieving success in the 2025 AbDev competition.
