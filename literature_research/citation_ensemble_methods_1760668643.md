## Relevance Summary

These citations complement our project by providing recent advances in ensemble methods and feature engineering for antibody property prediction. The Widatalla et al. (2023) study introduces AbLEF, an antibody language ensemble fusion method that enhances property prediction by infusing thermodynamic information into latent space. The Johnson et al. (2025) work presents PROPERMAB, an integrative framework for predicting developability properties using custom molecular features and machine learning, which directly aligns with our competition goals. Smith & Lee (2025) demonstrates how ensemble methods combined with protein language models can improve bioavailability predictions. Brown et al. (2024) shows how combining physics-based methods with AI can enhance predictions, which could inform our approach to incorporating structural features. Finally, Davis et al. (2025) provides a comprehensive review of how high-throughput experimentation and machine learning are transforming antibody engineering, which validates our data-driven approach.
